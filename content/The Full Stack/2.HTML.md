# [How are HTML and CSS used in the real world?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/lecture/MB2z2/how-are-html-and-css-used-in-the-real-world)

By now you know that HTML is a markup language used to create webpages. In fact, it's the most basic and fundamental language for creating webpages. Together with CSS, it has helped the web browser expand beyond just desktop computers.

## HTML

HTML has been around since 1990, and it was originally designed to provide a way for people to share information over the Internet. HTML webpages used to only show basic images and text.

The websites you browse today are very different. This is because HTML can do much more than just defining how content is displayed in the browser.

## CSS

HTML is great, but together with CSS, it can do so much more. CSS is a stylesheet language that is used to describe the look and layout of a document written in HTML. 

While CSS is not a programming language, it does allow for some programming like features, such as variables and nested rules. What it does is gives you control over color, size, spacing, fonts, positioning, and more.

One of the fundamental principles of CSS is the separation of content and style. That means you can change a webpages appearance without editing its underlying HTML.

==W3C==, the organization responsible for standards for the worldwide web, manages both HTML and CSS specifications. They continually improve their capabilities to ensure that they are always oriented towards current requirements. 

Many new features were added to the current version of HTML that make it easier to use than previous versions. These are:

- better support for multimedia content such as audio and video, 
- improved support for responsive design such as adopting the webpage layout depending on the device the webpage is viewed on, 
- new form input types such as sliders and range inputs, date and color pickers, 
- new form validation features, 
- new ways to work with texts such as spell checking and text editing.

Some major additions released for CSS in 2011 ensure that CSS can style and control a website regardless of the media content or the device used for viewing the page. The additions to the current version are:

- media queries, which allow for different styles to be applied depending on the device being used; 
- box sizing, which allows developers to specify how they want their content to be sized and padded; 
- multiple backgrounds, which means you can specify multiple background images for an element; 
- border images, which allow developers to specify an image as a border instead of a solid color or style; 
- text shadows, which means you can add shadows behind text for a more three-dimensional look; 
- transformations and transitions, which allow developers to animate elements on a webpage

In essence, the combination of HTML and CSS allows websites to adapt their design and layout based on the devices on which they're viewed. While this feature was initially used to support mobile devices like cell phones and tablets, the usage of HTML and CSS has grown beyond the traditional web browser and webpages.

Today, webpages can be viewed not only on computers, cell phones, and tablets, but also on video game consoles and even smart TVs. The web browser has truly expanded beyond traditional desktop devices, and it's all thanks to the combination of HTML and CSS.

# [Semantic tags and why we need them](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/lecture/m9ums/semantic-tags-and-why-we-need-them)

By now you know that HTML describes the content of a web page. But how do you describe the meaning of a web page, to understand this in a real world context think of buttons in an elevator.

The vertical arrangement of buttons isn't enough for someone to understand their meaning. To convey the meaning or semantics of the buttons numbers are added so that people know which button will take them to which floor. 

When you write HTML it's good practice to semantically describe the content. This allows search engines and accessibility software such as screen readers to understand the contents of a page.

fortunately you can do this by using some basic HTML tags. For example using a heading tags such as H1 describes that the content is a heading. Similarly the UL and OL tags describe lists. 

## Basic HTML page structure

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
```

Inside the body tag you can lay out the website with very semantic tags to describe each of the sections. 

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
		<header>
		</header>
		<main>
		</main>
		<footer>
		</footer>
	</body>
</html>
```

For a typical HTML page the structure can be semantically described using the header, main and footer semantic HTML tags.

For example, suppose you lay out your page with a header section that contains some company logo and navigation links. Then a main section contains sections and articles. Finally a footer section contains contact information and social media links. 

![[Pasted image 20240910180207.png]]

## nav

The main navigation section of your web page can also be described semantically using the ==Nav tag==.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
		<header>
			<nav>
			</nav>
		</header>
		<main>
		</main>
		<footer>
		</footer>
	</body>
</html>
```

Depending on how web pages designed the Nav element is often placed after the header element and the header element is used for logos. 

The main links of your website are then added inside the Nav element. It is common practice for developers to specify their links as an ==unordered list== inside the Nav element.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
		<header>
			<nav>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
					<li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
					<li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
			</nav>
		</header>
		<main>
		</main>
		<footer>
		</footer>
	</body>
</html>
```

## main

Next is the main content of a web page. The two key semantic elements for your main content are the ==article== and ==section== elements. 

### article

The HTML specification states that according to the World Wide Web Consortium's website, the article element indicates content which represents a complete or self contained composition in a document page application or site that is independently distributable.

That's quite a mouthful. It may help to think of a page in a newspaper. There are many articles on the page and you can cut out the individual articles with scissors if you want to. The articles you can remove are the article element. Examples of this include:

- a forum post, 
- a magazine or a newspaper article, 
- a blog entry, 
- a user submitted comment, 
- an interactive widget or gadget 
- or any other independent item of content

#### How article element is used

Say you are developing a blog about your summer holiday. It's good practice to contain the blog post content inside of the article element because it's a complete self-contained composition on a web page. 

You should place the article element within your main element. Then you add your regular heading and paragraph tags inside the article element.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
		<header>
		</header>
		<main>
			<article>
				<h2>My summer holiday</h2>
				<p>This summer I visited my grandparents.</p>
			</article>
		</main>
		<footer>
		</footer>
	</body>
</html>
```

The reason for doing it this way is because the main element semantically represents the main content of the page. And inside of it there can be multiple article elements for something like a blog post list.

## footer

This might contain additional navigation links or other content.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to note that semantic elements are not limited to this structure. Since their purpose is to describe the semantics of the content, the elements can be nested inside of each other, if it accurately describes the content.

## Nested semantic structure

You add a header element to the article element, inside the header element at the heading element with the blog title and a paragraph element describing the date and author of the blog post. Inside the main element at the content of the blog post.

```HTML
<body>
	<article>
		<header>
			<h2>My summer holiday</h2>
			<p>Posted on Monday, by Jane Wilson</p>
		</header>
		<main>
			<p>This summer I visited my grandparents.</p>
		</main>
	</article>
</body>
```

## section

You can add a section element to semantically define individual sections of the article.

```HTML
<body>
	<article>
		<header>
			<h2>My summer holiday</h2>
			<p>Posted on Monday, by Jane Wilson</p>
		</header>
		<main>
			<section>
				<h3>Day one</h3>
				<p>I arrived at my grandparents' house.</p>
			</section>
		</main>
	</article>
</body>
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to note that sections should contain heading elements to semantically describe the section.

It is also possible to use section elements to describe different sections of your webpage, the section element doesn't require the article element. It all depends on how you want to semantically describe your page.

# [Semantic tags in action](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/lecture/NEJ8h/semantic-tags-in-action)

The Little Lemon Restaurant has asked me to add a new blog page to their website. They've told me that the page will contain several blog posts, and that it must use semantic html so that search engines and accessibility software can understand the semantics of the page.

## `blog.html`

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Little Lemon</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
	<header>
	
	</header>
	<nav>
	
	</nav>
	<main>
	
	</main>
	<footer>
	
	</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Specifically the header element will be used to display the Little Lemon logo, and the nav element will be used to describe the navigational structure of the website. The main element will feature the main content of the web page, and the footer will be used to display copyright information. 

When a search engine or accessibility software reads this document, the semantic tags will help the software understand the purpose and meaning of different sections of the document.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Little Lemon</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
	<header>

	<nav>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
			<li><a href="location.html">Location</a></li>
			<li><a href="blog.html">Blog</a></li>
		</ul>
	</nav>
	<main>
		<h1>Blog</h1>

# [Forms and validation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/lecture/eVx18/forms-and-validation)

> [!INFO] Form validation
> Form validation is a process that ensures that the data entered by the user in a form is valid and conforms to rules defined by the developer. 

There are two methods of form validation, ==client-side validation== and ==server-side validation==.

## Client-side validation

Client-side validation checks for errors as soon as they are typed into the form. This is done by the web browser or by JavaScript code, and provide the user with immediate feedback. 

The client-side validation process starts by checking if a form has been filled out correctly. If there are no errors, the form will be submitted to the server for processing. However, if there are errors, an error message will alert the user of the invalid data and how to change it for successful submission.

For example, you decide to use the input element with its type attributes set to email. If the user does not enter a valid email address, the web browser will display an error message informing them that the data they entered is not a valid email address. 

## Server-side validation

On the other hand, server-side validation checks for errors after the data has been submitted to the web server. Server-side validation is ==more secure== because it prevents malicious users from tampering with your website's code and submitting invalid data to your server.

When the form data is received by the web server, the backend will validate the data before processing it. This validation can run more complex checks, such as checking the data against a database, or validating the data against business requirements. 

Most websites use ==both== client-side and server-side validation to provide immediate feedback to users, but also to protect against malicious data submission and to ensure data integrity.

## HTML client-side validation

HTML has several input types that are validated by the web browser. As demonstrated in the example,

- `"email"` is used for email addresses: `<input type="email">`
- `"tel"` for telephone numbers
- `"url"` for URLs such as `www.data.com`
- `"date"` for date values
- `"time"` for time values
- `"number"` for numeric values
- `"range"` for numeric values which have a minimum and maximum value
- `"color"` for color selection

Say for instance, a user makes mistakes on a user account form when entering a telephone number and URL, the browser will validate the entered data against the requirements of the input type and provide user feedback.

Another example is the required attribute, which indicates that the user must supply a value to an input field. The web browser will alert a user if a required value is outstanding.

![[Pasted image 20240911111838.png]]

---
# [Input types](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/supplement/FXL7l/input-types)

You already learned about the input HTML tag and how the type property determines the data your users can type in. This cheat sheet should be a reference to decide what type best suits your use case. Most of the inputs go hand in hand with the label tag for best accessibility practices.

## Button

This displays a clickable button and itâ€™s mostly used in HTML forms to activate a script when clicked.

```HTML
<inputâ€¯type="button"â€¯value="Click me"â€¯onclick="msg()" />
```

Keep in mind, you can also define buttons with the `<button>` tag, with the added benefit of being able to place content like text or images inside the tag.

```HTML
<button onclick="alert('Are you sure you want to continue?')"> 
    <img src="https://yourserver.com/button_img.jpg" 
        alt="Submit the form" height="64" width="64">
â€¯</button> 
```

## Checkbox

Defines a check box allowing single values to be selected or deselected. They are used to let a user select one or more options from a limited number of choices.

```HTML
<inputâ€¯type="checkbox"â€¯id="dog"â€¯name="dog"â€¯value="Dog">
<labelâ€¯for="dog">I like dogs</label>
<inputâ€¯type="checkbox"â€¯id="cat"â€¯name="cat"â€¯value="Cat">
<labelâ€¯for="cat">I like cats</label>
```

## Radio

Displays a radio button, allowing only a single value to be selected out of multiple choices. They are normally presented in radio groups, which are collections of radio buttons describing a set of related options that share the same name attribute.

```HTML
<inputâ€¯type="radio"â€¯id="light"â€¯name="theme"â€¯value="Light"> 
<labelâ€¯for="light">Light</label> 
<inputâ€¯type="radio"â€¯id="dark"â€¯name="theme"â€¯value="Dark"> 
<labelâ€¯for="dark">Dark</label> 
```

## Submit

Displays a submit button for submitting all values from an HTML form to a form-handler, typically a server. The form-handler is specified in the formâ€™s `action` attribute.

```HTML
<formâ€¯action="myserver.com"â€¯method="POST">
Â  â€¦
<inputâ€¯type="submit"â€¯value="Submit" />
</form>
```

## Text

Defines a basic single-line text field that a user can enter text into.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="fname">First name:</label> 
<inputâ€¯type="text"â€¯id="fname"â€¯name="fname"> 
```

## Password

Defines a single-line text field whose value is obscured, suited for sensitive information like passwords.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="pwd">Password:</label> 
<inputâ€¯type="password"â€¯id="pwd"â€¯name="pwd"> 
```

## Date

Displays a control for entering a date (year, month and day) with no time.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="dob">Date of birth:</label>
<inputâ€¯type="date"â€¯id="dob"â€¯name="date of birth">
```

## Datetime-local

Defines a control for entering a date and time, including the year, month and day, as well as the time in hours and minutes.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="birthdaytime">Birthday (date and time):</label>
<inputâ€¯type="datetime-local"â€¯id="birthdaytime"â€¯name="birthdaytime">
```

## Email

Defines a field for an email address. Itâ€™s similar to plain text input, with the addition that it validates automatically when submitted to the server.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="email">Enter your email:</label>
<inputâ€¯type="email"â€¯id="email"â€¯name="email">
```

## **File**

Displays a control that lets the user select and upload a file from their computer. To define the types of files permissible you can use the `accept` attribute. Also, to enable multiple files to be selected, add the `multiple` attribute.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="myfile">Select a file:</label>
<inputâ€¯type="file"â€¯id="myfile"â€¯name="myfile">
```

## **Hidden**

Defines a control that is not displayed but whose value is still submitted to the server.

```HTML
<inputâ€¯type="hidden"â€¯id="custId"â€¯name="custId"â€¯value="3487">
```

## **Image**

Defines an image as a graphical submit button. You should use the `src` attribute to point to the location of your image file.

```HTML
<inputâ€¯type="image"src="submit_img.png"â€¯alt="Submit"â€¯width="48"â€¯height="48">
```

## **Number**

Defines a control for entering a number. You can use attributes to specify restrictions, such as min and max values allowed, number intervals or a default value.

```HTML
<inputâ€¯type="number"â€¯id="quantity"â€¯name="quantity"â€¯min="1"â€¯max="5">
```

## **Range**

Displays a range widget for specifying a number between two values. The precise value, however, is not considered important. This is typically represented using a slider or dial control. To define the range of acceptable values, use the `min` and `max` properties.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="volume">Volume:</label>
<inputâ€¯type="range"â€¯id="volume"â€¯name="volume"â€¯min="0"â€¯max="10">
```

## **Reset**

Displays a button that resets the contents of the form to their default values.

```HTML
<inputâ€¯type="reset">
```

## **Search**

Defines a text field for entering a search query. These are functionally identical to text inputs, but may be styled differently depending on the browser.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="gsearch">Search in Google:</label>
<inputâ€¯type="search"â€¯id="gsearch"â€¯name="gsearch">
```

## Time

Displays a control for entering a time value in hours and minutes, with no time zone.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="appt">Select a time:</label>
<inputâ€¯type="time"â€¯id="appt"â€¯name="appt">
```

## **Tel**

Defines a control for entering a telephone number. Browsers that do not support `tel` fall back to standard text input. You can optionally use the `pattern` field to perform validation.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="phone">Enter your phone number:</label>
<inputâ€¯type="tel"â€¯id="phone"â€¯name="phone"â€¯pattern="[+]{1}[0-9]{11,14}">
```

## **Url**

Displays a field for entering a text URL. It works similarly to a text input, but performs automatic validation before being submitted to the server.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="homepage">Add your homepage:</label>
<inputâ€¯type="url"â€¯id="homepage"â€¯name="homepage">
```

## **Week**

Defines a control for entering a date consisting of a week-year number and a year, with no time zone. Keep in mind that this is a newer type that is not supported by all browsers.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="week">Select a week:</label>
<inputâ€¯type="week"â€¯id="week"â€¯name="week">
```

## **Month**

Displays a control for entering a month and year, with no time zone. Keep in mind that this is a newer type that is not supported by all browsers.

```HTML
<labelâ€¯for="bdaymonth">Birthday (month and year):</label>
<inputâ€¯type="month"â€¯id="bdaymonth"â€¯name="bdaymonth" min="1930-01" value="2000-01">
```

# [Form submission](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/lecture/Gn9ZI/form-submission)

By now, you know that the web browser communicates with a web server using a HTTP request response cycle. This means that the web browser sends requests to the web server, and the web server sends back a response. 

Up to now, the main type of requests you've been introduced to were for resources such as HTML documents, images, CSS files, and JavaScript files. But it is also possible to send data as part of a request. This is how form send data to the web server. In fact, there are two ways a form can send data to the web server using the ==HTTP GET== method or the ==HTTP POST== method.

You can specify which method the form should use with the method attribute of the form element. 

![[Pasted image 20240911112844.png]]

## Form with `GET` method

This login form, excepts a username and password. It also has a login button that submits the form to the web server. 

![[Pasted image 20240911112935.png]]

How would it work if the method attribute is set to GET?

When the Login button is clicked, the form data is sent as part of the request URL. This means that the user data is appended to the end of the URL in the web browser navigation bar. 

![[Pasted image 20240911113033.png]]

The web server receives the HTTP GET request, and extracts the form data from the URL.

While this is an easy way to submit data, it has three key problems.

1. First, the length of a URL is limited to around 2,000 characters depending on the web browser you're using. Some web browsers allow more, but there are inconsistencies between browsers. So if you have a large form, some data may be lost when it sent via the GET Method to the web server. 
2. Second, the length of a requested URL is also limited on some web servers. Popular web server software such as Apache web server or Engine X, have a default limit of around 4,096 characters. Again, if you have a large form, some data may be lost.
3. The final problem is security. Since the data is included as part of the URL, it means that your data is stored in your web browser history and possibly in the request logs on the web server. If you're transmitting personal information such as addresses or credit card numbers, this is a major privacy and security risk. 

## Form with `POST` method

![[Pasted image 20240911113301.png]]

When the form is submitted using the post method, the form data is inserted into the content of the HTTP request. When the submit button is pressed, it will send an HTTP post request with the data contained in the body of the request.

The HTTP post method is ==more secure== than the HTTP GET method. However, the data could still be read by a third party listening to the HTTP request.

To secure this completely, ==HTTPS== is used to encrypt the data so that only the sender and receiver can understand the data.

Once the web server receives the request, it processes it and sends back an HTTP response. If the request was successful, the response will direct the web browser to a new webpage. If errors occurred, there are many ways this can be handled by the webpage.

# [Submit](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/supplement/NXnpe/submit)

You have recently learned about how forms are sent to web servers and the difference between `GET` and `POST`. In this reading, you will build on this knowledge by learning about Submit.

## Action and method

Form submissions are an essential part of the world wide web. Nearly every website uses forms, from buying items online to ordering food for delivery. When you click the login button on a website, it sends your username and password to a web server to log you into your account. As you know by now, you add a form to your web page using the form tag.

```HTML
<form> 
</form> 
```

But how the form is submitted is determined by two essential attributes: `action` and `method`. 

The `action` attribute specifies to which web address the form must be sent. This address is the location of server-side code that will process the request.

```HTML
<formâ€¯action="/login"> 
</form> 
```

It is important to note that `action` can be a full URL address such as `https://meta.com`, an absolute path such as `/login`, or a relative path such as `login`. 

The absolute path, which starts with a forward slash, will use the base address of the current website, such as `https://meta.com` and combine it with the absolute path. For example, if `/login` is the absolute path, the form will be submitted to `https://meta.com/login`. If the address is `https://meta.com/company-info/` and `/login` is the absolute path, the submission address will still be `https://meta.com/login`.

Similarly, a relative path will combine the current web address with a relative path. For example, if the web browser is currently on the web page `https://meta.com/company-info/`, and the relative path is set to `login`, the form will be submitted to `https://meta.com/company-info/login`. The method attribute specifies which HTTP method is used to submit the form; `GET` or `POST`.

```HTML
<formâ€¯method="get"> 
</form> 
```

```HTML
<formâ€¯method="post"> 
</form> 
```

The form will default to the HTTP `GET` method when the method attribute is not provided. 

As you may already know, when the form is submitted using the HTTP `GET` method, the data in the form's fields are encoded in the URL. And when the form is submitted using the HTTP `POST` method, the data is sent as part of the HTTP request body. 

When the web server receives the request, it processes the data and sends back an HTTP response. The response indicates the result of the submission, which can be successful or unsuccessful due to invalid or incorrect data. 

However, as a front-end developer, it is essential to know that forms are not the only way to submit data to the web server. As you learn more about JavaScript and front-end libraries, youâ€™ll discover that developers often submit HTTP requests directly via code and send data as part of the HTTP request body in a text format called JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON. 

For now, practice building HTML forms and submitting data to the web server using the different attributes available.
