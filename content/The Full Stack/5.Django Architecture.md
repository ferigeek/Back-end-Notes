## Introduction

If you set up your full stack development environment with the right tools, you can use your time more effectively during the development process. By using effective tools, you can make the development process fast and fun. This reading will introduce you to some essential tools for full stack development.

## The terminal

In full stack development, you must familiarize yourself with using terminals and command-line tools. This is where you can run commands to build Django projects, manage builds and communicate with your server and the database. If you are not using the terminal, you can't use Django, install the dependencies or use JavaScript to properly build tools. In macOS and Linux, you can use the app called terminal and in Windows, you use PowerShell for this purpose.

## Django specific tools

By now you should know that when using Django for your project, it's always a good idea to avoid using global environments to manage your package dependencies. Pipenv is a fantastic command line tool that only manages your dependencies but also does so in a virtual environment, avoiding any possible conflicts between the packages. Download it from the [Pipenv website.](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

## Database

While Django can use SQLite, a file-based database system, it can work with many others. And MySQL and MariaDB are some of the most popular and widely used database engines by developers worldwide. You can install MySQL on your machine using the installer from their website or using the package managers available for your operating system.

## Editor

A good code editor can really speed up your development by providing essential features like debuggers, quick refactoring and syntax highlighting. Additionally, there are many add-ons or extensions that you can install which provide even more functionalities. Visual Studio Code is a great editor that has everything you need to start developing in different programming languages. And the best part is, it's free. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) here.

## API testing

To test the APIs that you build, you need a REST API client to make different API calls and send JSON or form URL encoded payloads and headers. Postman, Insomnia, and HTTpie are three popular REST clients you can use for free. They are cross-platform and very user-friendly. Here are a few helpful links to get you started with API testing:

- [Postman API platform for building and using APIs](https://www.postman.com/)
- [Postman Echo service to test REST clients and make sample API calls](https://postman-echo.com/)
- [Insomnia homepage](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [Getting started with Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/get-started)
- [Httpbin HTTP request and response service](https://httpbin.org/)  

## Version control

An effective version control system is a must-have for any full stack developer. Using a version control system like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), you can maintain different versions of your code and you can also roll back to any particular state in the past at any time. Fortunately, these days version control systems are integrated with the build tools.

## Front-end tools

When using front-end frameworks like React, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system to access it from the command line. You also need a package manager like [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to deal with the dependencies and a build tool like [Vite.jsor](https://vitejs.dev/) [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to build the production version of your code. These days, Vite is a popular and fast building tool you can use for free. 

## Conclusion

With the proper development environment, you can make your development journey really enjoyable and productive. The correct tools help you to write quality code fast and avoid common errors. In this reading, you learned what tools you should have in your toolbelt to become an excellent full stack developer.

# [Optional: Creating a Django project (steps and code)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/supplement/N0Su0/optional-creating-a-django-project-steps-and-code)

## Introduction

This reading will give you an overview of the steps you should take when creating a Django project while working with VS Code and using pipenv as your virtual environment. The project structure can be vary according to your preferences, but the one suggested is easy to use.

**Note:** _The instructions in this reading may vary slightly from the instructions in the video about creating a Django project because the video presumes a preconfigured Pipfile._

**Note:** _The commands added below are specific to MacOS. The learner will have to make OS specific changes such as using keyword_ _**python**_ _instead of_ _**python3**_ _for Windows OS._

### Step 1

Open VS Code on your computer and click on **File**. In the drop-down menu select **Open Folder** and select the folder you have created for the project.

![[Pasted image 20240919112612.png]]

Now click on **Terminal** and select **New Terminal** from the drop-down menu. This is the main folder that contains all your files for the Django project you are going to create.

### Step 2

Create a directory for the Django project by running the following command:

`mkdir LittleLemon`

### Step 3

Step inside the LittleLemon directory with the command:

cd LittleLemon

### Step 4

Run the following command to create a project in this directory:

`django-admin startproject myproject .`

**Note:** You can run the command above without using the dot(.) at the end. However, the relative position of directory and commands executed below must change accordingly. Without the dot(.), Django creates a nesting directory with a name same as the nested project name.

### Step 5

Run the command to activate **pipenv**:

`pipenv shell`

**Note:** It is expected that **pipenv** is installed using **pip** on your local machine.

### Step 6

Open the file labeled **Pipfile** that was created inside the project directory. This file contains details of the dependencies for the project. Update it with the following code and save the file.

![[Pasted image 20240919112727.png]]

```
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"
 
[packages]
django = "*"
djangorestframework = "*"
djangorestframework-xml = "*"
mysqlclient = "*"
 
[dev-packages]
 
[requires]
python_version = "3.9"

```

**Note:** The packages added as dependencies are specific to the lab and functionalities you will require.

**Note:** While copy-pasting the file content above, ensure any special characters added automatically are removed. They may appear in yellow or between code blocks in your VSCode.

### Step 7

Run this command to install the dependencies using the updated **Pipfile**:

`pipenv install`

**Note:** _Alternatively, you can also use a command like_ `pipenv install django` to install specific packages. This will also update the_ _**Pipfile**__._

### Step 8

Now run this command to create a Django app:

`python3 manage.py startapp myapp`

### Step 9

Run the command to start the server to test if the installation was successful.

`python3 manage.py runserver`

Stop the server by pressing **Ctrl** + **C** while you are in the Terminal window.

###  **Step 10**

Create the **urls.py** file in the app-level **LittleLemonDRF** directory.

![[Pasted image 20240919112935.png]]

Paste the following code inside it:

```Python
from django.urls import path
from . import views
 
urlpatterns = [
    path('ratings', views.ratings),
]
```

**Note:** _The specific url configurations will differ according to the views created._

### Step 11

Open the **urls.py** file in the project-level directory and update the code as follows:

```Python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
 
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('home/',include('myapp.urls')),
]
```

**Note:** _The specific url configurations at the project-level will vary according to the name of the app created._

### Conclusion

In this reading, you learned about the initial setup you need to make on your local machine while running VS Code with **pipenv** to create a Django project.
