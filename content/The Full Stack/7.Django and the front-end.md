# [Fetching data using JavaScript](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/lecture/Ejqhf/fetching-data-using-javascript)

JavaScript, as you have learned, is a scripting language that dynamically updates data, multimedia and other components on a website. While you can use JavaScript and Django in the infinite number of ways to develop a full stack application, developers primarily follow one of two major approaches. ==Client-first== or ==server-first==.

## Client-first

In-client first architecture, front end is the highest priority. When following this architecture, you first build applications using JavaScript and other frameworks such as React and processes such as templating and URL routing. 

Django is then later used primarily for coding the interaction with the database and utilizing utility apps such as the DRF.

## Server-first

On the other hand, with server-first architecture, you start by building the components of an application using Django APIs before you work with the front end.

Fortunately, Django makes it possible to add JavaScript components inside HTML templates. The missing gaps can then be filled using JavaScript, AJAX, and simple event handling mechanisms to build a solid foundation for web applications.

A back end developer will prefer taking a server-first approach. While there are several supportive libraries for JavaScript, you can build a simple form by just using the native JavaScript functionalities.

## Creating comment section following Server-first approach

### Outline of the process

The form will be updated by an API endpoint which uses a post method to send a request to the Django view.

The entered user data or comment is then added to a MySQL database which was created earlier using models in Django.

![[Pasted image 20240921081658.png]]

So, using the DOM event type in JavaScript called `addEventListener` and fetch API in JavaScript, you make a POST request to the forms action URL before converting it into JSON data and sending it to the database. 

You have created your Django project an app and configured the URLs. Additionally, you have already updated database settings for MySQL inside the `settings.py` file with `blog_db` as your database name. You have set the user name and password to `root` for simplicity. It is not good practice to assign them the root value in production environments.

```Python
# models.py

from django.db import models

class UserComments(models.Model):
	first_name = models.CharField(max_length = 200)
	last_name = models.CharField(max_length = 200)
	comment = models.CharField(max_length = 1000)
```

```Python
# forms.py

from django import forms
from .models import UserComments

class CommentForm(forms.ModelForm):
	class Meta:
		model = UserComments
		fields = '__all__'
```

You're going to use this view function for two things, rendering and processing the form data and then sending it to your model. 

```Python
# views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from myapp.forms import CommentForm
from .models import UserComments
from django.http import JsonResponse

def form_view(request):
	form = CommentForm()

	if request.method == 'POST':
		form = CommentForm(request.POST)
		if form.is_valid():
			cd = form.cleaned_data
			uc = UserComment(
				first_name = cd['first_name'],
				last_name = cd['last_name'],
				comment = cd['comment'],
			)
			uc.save()
	return render(request, 'blog.html', {'form': form})
```

Create a `templates` folder in the app directory and make a `blog.html` in it.

```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	 <!-- Required meta tags -->
	 <meta charset="utf-8">
	 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

	<!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com...">
	<title>Comment Section</title>
</head>
<body class="bg-light">
<div class="container pt-4">
	<h1>User Comments</h1>
	<form method="POST" id="form">
		{% csrf_token %}
		{{ form.as_p}}
		<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
	</form>
</div>

<script>
	const form = document.getElemetById('form');
		form.addEventListener("submit", submitHandler);
		
		function submitHandler(e){
			e.preventDefault();
			
			fetch(form.action, {method: 'POST', body: new FormData(form)})
			.then(response=>response.json())
			.then(data=>{
				if (data.message === 'success'){
					alert('Success');
					form.reset()
				}
			})
		}
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Call the fetch function and pass some arguments inside it. This line makes a POST request to the form's action URL. The dot that follows is a promise made by the fetch function that represents an eventual completion of an operation that may be a synchronous.

Inside it, pass the response object that is first converted into JSON. In the next dot then function the JSON data gets processed. If the processing is completed, JavaScript will send a successful submission alert. Finally, add a line to reset the form after submission.

```Python
# views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from myapp.forms import CommentForm
from .models import UserComments
from django.http import JsonResponse

def form_view(request):
	form = CommentForm()

	if request.method == 'POST':
		form = CommentForm(request.POST)
		if form.is_valid():
			cd = form.cleaned_data
			uc = UserComment(
				first_name = cd['first_name'],
				last_name = cd['last_name'],
				comment = cd['comment'],
			)
			uc.save()
			return JsonResponse({'message': 'success'})
	return render(request, 'blog.html', {'form': form})
```

```Terminal
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

# [Querying APIs using JavaScript](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/supplement/zdftF/querying-apis-using-javascript)

## Introduction

After the lesson on JavaScript you know you can do exciting things with it. You can use it for client-side programming, to make a web application interactive or to send and receive data from the server. JavaScript really is the default choice when it comes to front-end programming.

But it can also be used for back-end purposes and in this reading you will learn how to use JavaScript to fetch and send data to an API using the native fetch function.

## Native solution versus third-party libraries

When it comes to fetching data from APIs you might ask yourself, should I use the native fetch function `XMLHttpRequest` object, or should I go with libraries like jQuery or Axios? Let’s contextualize the question with some background information.

Previously, fetching data from APIs with `XMLHttpRequest` object was difficult because you have to write quite a lot of code to make a simple request. But, at the time, there was no alternative option. Then came third-party libraries that work as a wrapper around `XMLHttpRequest` and which provide a simpler interface. These libraries quickly became popular. Later versions of JavaScript came with another native API called fetch, which is powerful, simple and easy to use.

Though using the fetch API is easy, you still have to manually adjust a few things and write extra code for error checking and header processing. This is why libraries like Axios are still popular because they provide a simpler interface and automatically take care of a lot of issues so that you don’t have to write so much code. Ultimately, you can use either the native fetch API or Axios library. Both are viable options since both solve the problem of fetching data from APIs in a straightforward manner.

Now let’s explore how you can make `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` calls using the fetch API and how to make authenticated calls using tokens.

## Making a GET call

Placing a `GET` call using fetch is simple. All you have to do is make the call, convert the response to JSON or text and then process it any way you want. Here is the output from the **menu-items** endpoint of the Little Lemon restaurant app that was used in the course on APIs. Use the following code to make a `GET` call to this endpoint:

```JS
fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
    })
```

## POST, PUT and PATCH Calls

How do you make a `POST` call with data using the fetch API? You have to convert the JSON payload that contains all the data to a string using the  `JSON.stringify()` function and pass it as body in the second argument to the fetch function. It’s also a good practice to add **Accept** and **Content** type headers while making the API calls.

Here is the sample code that creates a new menu item by making a `POST` call to the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items` endpoint.

```JS
const payload = {
    "title": "Ambrosia Ice cream",
    "price": 5.00,
    "inventory": 100
}
const endpoint = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items'
fetch(endpoint,
    {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
    })
```

For `PUT` and `PATCH` calls, you just change the method from `POST` to `PUT` or `PATCH`. These requests typically operate on a single resource, which is identified by including an ID in the URL. Everything else remains the same.

## DELETE calls

For `DELETE` calls, change the method to `DELETE` and that’s all. In most cases, there is no body passed to a `DELETE` call. Here’s the code for a sample `DELETE` call to the **menu-items** endpoint:

```JS
const endpoint = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items/17'
fetch(endpoint,
    {
        method: 'DELETE',
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
    })
```

## Making authenticated calls with tokens

If you want to make authenticated API calls using bearer tokens, pass the **Authentication** header in the second argument in the fetch function. Here is an authenticated `POST` call. Note how the bearer token is passed in the header section.

```JS
const endpoint = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items/17'
const token = “Some token”
fetch(endpoint,
    {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authentictation': 'Bearer ' + token
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data)
    })
```

You can do the same for `GET` calls as well.

## Conclusion

In this reading, you learned about making API calls in JavaScript using the native fetch function and how to process the response. You also learned how to send a JSON payload to make `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` calls.

# [Exercise: Submitting a form with JavaScript](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-full-stack/supplement/lxFFM/exercise-submitting-a-form-with-javascript)

## **Lab assets**

You are provided with a basic setup for a Django environment for the project and app inside the zip file below.

![Submitting a Form with JavaScript](./Media/fAW4B1Y2QjK0d88n46_-NQ_e83be2a5c9b446c9bbf4a29ab41f31f1_Submitting-a-Form-with-JavaScript.zip)

The zip file contains a template to be used along with supportive files to run the lab.

Note that the virtual environment using **pipenv** has been added as a part of the zip file. You must activate the virtual environment and ensure dependencies are installed. 

### **Objectives**

- Set up a JavaScript event to submit form data as a JSON object
- Display a successful form submission alert using JavaScript    

## **Introduction**

Your goal is to submit form data as a JSON object using JavaScript event handling and display submission alert.

## **Initial lab instructions**

This lab will require you to modify the following files: 

- **views.py**
- **templates/feedback.html**

Starter code has already been added to the following files:

- **settings.py**
- **forms.py**
- **models.py**
- **urls.py (app-level)**
- **urls.py (project-level)**

Additionally, you are required to use the command line console inside the terminal of VS Code. 

If not open already, go to **Terminal** on the Menu bar at the top of your screen and select **New Terminal**.

![[Pasted image 20240921090047.png]]

The project named **myproject** and an app inside the project called **myapp** are preconfigured. 

Follow the instructions below and ensure you check the output at every step.

 **Note:** _Make sure you have installed MySQL on your local machine and that you have set up the root user. In this lab, to keep it simple, you are going to begin with the_ _**root**_ _user credentials. The root user by default has the password which is either_ _**password**_ _or_ _**`<blank>`**__. In case of a blank password, simply press_ _**Enter**__. Also, note that the password won’t be visible as it’s being typed._ 

# Steps

**Step 1:** 

Open the file **settings.py** and double-check that the configurations in place for MySQL match the local machine. Create the database name present inside the file to your local machine if not already present. If not added, Django will throw an error.

![[Pasted image 20240921090118.png]]

**Note:** _Before you deal with the database, make sure the user created for the database and added inside the_ _**settings.py**_ _file in Django has all the privileges required for accessing and modifying the database._ 

Run the necessary commands to make sure the user is created and can access the database. 

**Step 2:**

Open the file **models.py** and observe the model created for the lab. Now open the file **forms.py** and note the form created for the purpose of the lab. Take note that form fields present inside both the form and the model are the same. You will understand the reasons for this shortly.  

**Note:** There are easier ways of creating forms from a model using Meta class. The code added here is for clarity. 

**Step 3:**

Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:

`pipenv shell`

**Note:** _Make sure you run this command in the main working directory containing the_ _**manage.py**_ _file._ 

**Step 4:**

To make sure you have the necessary dependencies in place, run the command inside **pipenv**:

`pipenv install django`

`pipenv install mysqlclient`

**Step 5:**

Now run both commands to perform migrations. 

**Note:** _Make sure you are inside the directory that contains_ _**manage.py**_ _file._

On running migrations, you may encounter an error such as the one below:

![[Pasted image 20240921090145.png]]

If this happens, there is a conflict in the rows present inside your table from your earlier migration. The easy solution is to select option **1** and provide a one-off value such as **null** as a string. 

 **Step 6:**

Open the file **views.py** to create a configuration for the template you want to create.

The necessary imports are already added and the view function called `form_view()` is created.

Follow the steps below to implement the pseudo code and add the code inside the view function:

-  if value of `request.method` is `‘POST’`
    - assign value of `MenuForm(request.POST)` to a variable called `form`
    - if `form.is_valid()`
        - assign value of `form.cleaned_data` to a variable called `cd`
        - assign the value of `Menu()` to a variable called `mf` and pass the following arguments inside it:
            - `item_name = cd[‘item_name’]`
            - `category = cd[‘category’]`
            - `description = cd[‘description’]`
        - initialize the `save()` function on the object variable mf
        - return `JsonResponse({‘message’ : ‘success’})`
- return `render()` function with following arguments passed inside it:
    - `request`
    - `‘menu_items.html’`
    - `{‘form’: form}`

 Save the **views.py** file and ensure the code has no errors. 

**Note:** _The template name does not have to be the same as the database name which in this case is_ `menu_items`.

 **Step 7:**

Open the **menu_items.html** file and add the following starter code inside it:

```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
          integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <title>Menu Items </title>
</head>
<body class="bg-light">
<div class="container pt-4">
    <h1>Menu Items </h1>
    <form method="POST" id="form">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
    </form>
</div>
```

 **Note:** _Pay attention to the Bootstrap added as a part of the HTML code inside your template._ 

**Step 8:**

Below the code added, you will add a code for the `<script>` tag. Make sure you also add the closing tag for the script tag. 

**Step 9:**

The code for enabling the JavaScript functionality is written inside the script tag. Follow the pseudo-code below and add the JavaScript code inside the enclosing `<script>` tags:

**Note:** _Make sure you add a semi-colon (_;_)_ _after each line of code. Unlike Python, JavaScript requires a semi-colon to end a code block._ 

Create a constant called `form` using the keyword `const` and assign it the value of `document.getElementbyId(‘form’);`.

Call the `addEventListener()` over the form variable by using the dot operator and pass the following arguments inside it:

- `“submit”`
- `submitHandler`

Create a function called `submitHandler()` using the keyword function and pass the variable called `e` to it as an argument. 

- Add the following code inside the function:
    - `e.preventDefault()`
    - `fetch()` function with following arguments passed inside it:
        - `form.action`
        - dictionary with following two key-value pairs:
            - method: `‘POST’`
            - body: `new FormData(form)`
    - add `.then()` function and the following code inside it: 
        - `response=>response.json()`
    - add `.then()` function and the following argument inside it:

```JS
.then(data=>{
                if (data.message === 'success') {
                    alert('Success!');
                    form.reset()
            }
        });
```

Make sure the code has no errors and save the **menu_items.html** file. 

**Step 10:**

Add a command to run the server and go to the localhost URL. Observe the web page that renders the form. 

**Step 11:**

Add one random item with the item name, category and description in the form. On entering the form data and pressing the submit button, observe that the **Success!** message is displayed as an alert in your browser. Repeat this process for the other entries.

**Step 12:**

In the terminal, run the command that will enable access to **mysql** and enter the **mysql** shell by passing the -u and -p flags that will enable the MySQL console to prompt for a password. 

**Note:** _The password set for_ _**mysql**_ _here will be the same_ _as set for root._

**Step 13:**

Run the commands to enter the database you have created for your Django project and enter the table name **myapp_menu** that is generated. 

Run the command to observe if the database entry you have created inside the form has been added inside the database. 

Alternatively, you can also use a third-party database tool for MySQL to observe the contents of the database.

**Note:** _You will not see any entry in the table if it is empty and the code will need to be updated accordingly._ 

## **Conclusion**

In this lab, you have learned how to set up JavaScript events to submit to form data as a JSON object and display an alert on successful form submission.
