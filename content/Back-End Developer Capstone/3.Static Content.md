# [Recap: Django Routes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/ZzRon/recap-django-routes)

## Introduction

The Django framework adopts an **MVT** approach. The model is the data layer of the application. The view layer is responsible for processing the request and returning the response. The template is the presentation layer.

Another crucial component of the Django architecture is the URL dispatcher.

## URL dispatcher

The URL dispatcher is equivalent to Controller in the **MVC** architecture. The **urls.py** module in the Django project's package folder acts as the dispatcher. 

It defines the URL patterns. Each URL pattern is mapped with a view function to be invoked when the client's request URL matches it. 

The URL patterns defined in each app under the project are also included in it.

When the server receives a request in the form of a client URL, the dispatcher matches its pattern with the patterns available in the **urls.py** and routes the flow of the application toward its associated view.

Suppose a new Django project called `littlelemon` is created. The **urls.py** file in the project package shows the following code by default:

#**littlelemon/urls.py**

```Python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
 
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

The code contains a `urlpatterns` list. And inside the list is a collection of URL routes where each route is constructed with the `path()` function.

The `path()` function matches a URL endpoint string with the function you want to be called.

## Create Restaurant app

As you develop an app inside the Django project, you must decide which URL patterns you'll expose to the user and which function you want to execute when each URL is requested.

The functions are defined in the **views.py** file inside the app package folder.

#**restaurant/views.py**

```Python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def sayHello(request):
 return HttpResponse('Hello World')
```

Suppose that all the routes of the restaurant app will start from /restaurant.

The `sayHello()` view function from the code snippet in the **views.py** file above will be called when the user requests the URL path `restaurant/`.

This mapping is declared in the urls.py module of the app. And you define all the URL routes of the app in this file.

#**restaurant/urls.py**

```Python
from django.contrib import admin 
from django.urls import path 
from .views import sayHello 
  
urlpatterns = [ 
    path('', sayHello, name='sayHello'), 
]
```

## Include app URL configuration in project URL Configuration

Since the **urls.py** file in the project package is the URL dispatcher, we need to include the routes of the app in it. Update it to contain the following code:

#**littlelemon/urls.py**

```Python
from django.contrib import admin 
from django.urls import path, include  
 
urlpatterns = [ 
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls), 
    path('restaurant/', include('restaurant.urls')),
]
```

Finally, add the restaurant app to the INSTALLED_APPS list in the **littlelemon/settings.py** file, run the server and visit the localhost URL [http://localhost/restaurant/](http://localhost/restaurant/). 

Notice that the Hello World message is displayed.

# [Exercise: Setting up the static routes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/TEWsS/exercise-setting-up-the-static-routes)

## **Overview**

With Django’s powerful Templating language, you can render the HTML pages as the response to a client.

The default Django project template installs the `staticfiles` app. It provides the functionality for including static assets such as images, JavaScript and CSS files on the web page.

In this exercise, you will define a URL route whose mapped view renders a web page. You will also include an image in the HTML script of the web page.

You can find the resources for these static assets from the link below.

![Static routes assets](./Media/_ozfC8MeRya4iwepjfZtXg_806971f605b842c4a88cff4cd0b7b6e1_Static-routes-assets.zip)

## **Scenario**

You will be displaying the home page of your web app for your Capstone project application.

## **Prerequisites**

You have already installed the Django framework in a Python virtual environment. You have also created a Django project with `LittleLemon` as its name, and it has a Django app called `restaurant`.

**Step 1: Create a templates directory**

The project package folder and the app package folder both are created inside the outer folder which is identified as `BASE_DIR`. Inside this `BASE_DIR` create a template directory/folder named `templates`.

**Step 2: Include the templates directory in settings.py**

In VS Code, go to the `TEMPLATES` section in the **settings.py** file and ensure that the templates directory created in the above step is in the list of the `DIRS` attribute.

```Python
#Include 'templates' in 'DIRS' attribute
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': ['templates'],
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

**Step 3: Create index.html**

Inside the templates folder, create a new file called **index.html** and put the following script in it.

```HTML
<html>
   <head>
      <title>Capstone Project</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome ToLittleLemon Restaurant</h1>
   </body>
</html>
```

**Step 4: Define index view**

Open the **views.py** file from the `restaurant` folder. Add the following function:

```Python
from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
def index(request):
    return render(request, 'index.html', {})
```

**Step 5: Add the URL route**

Open the `urls.py` file from the `restaurant` folder. Make sure that the following path is added to the `urlpatterns` list.

```Python
#define URL route for index() view
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    . . . ,
    path('', views.index, name='index')
]
```

**Step 6: Update URLConf**

Open the **urls.py** file from the `Littlelemon` folder. Include the URL patterns of the `restaurant` app in it.

```Python
#update URLConf by including URL patterns of restaurant app
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
   path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
   path(restaurant/', include(restaurant.urls'))
]
```

**Step 7: Visit the home page**

Run the Django server with the `manage.py` script and visit the `http://localhost:8000/restaurant/` URL.

**Step 8: Save the LittleLemon.png image**

All the static assets must be placed in the **restaurant/static/restaurant** folder. Put the littlelemon.png file here.

**Step 9: add the static tag in index.html**

Modify the **index.html** file to include the following statements.

```HTML
<!--add this template tag-->
{% load static %}
<img src="{% static 'restaurant/littlelemon.png' %}">
```

**Step 10: Refresh the home page**

You should see the image rendered on the browser.

**Conclusion**

In this exercise, you successfully rendered a web page with a static image file.
