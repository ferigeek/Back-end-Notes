# [Recap: User Authentication](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/ivR0f/recap-user-authentication)

## Introduction

When a REST API exposes the back-end models to the external world, the access needs to be authenticated. 

Django framework provides a basic session-based authentication. Certain middleware components are needed for Django's auth backends authenticate requests.

Django REST Framework presents different other authentication schemes other than session-based authentication. 

Token-based authentication is the most suited one when the web application interacts with desktop and mobile clients.

## Prerequisites

A Python virtual environment is set up with Django as well as Django REST Framework installed in it.

A Django project with the name LittleLemon is created. Inside it, a Django app with LittleLemonAPI its name is also present.

## Enable Token Authentication

Add `'rest_framework'`, `'LittleLemonAPI'`, and `'rest_framework.authtoken'` in the project's **settings.py** file and run the migrate command:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

Visit the admin panel with [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) URL and log in with superuser credentials.

The site administration dashboard shows the **AUTH TOKEN** section.

## Model

Open the VS Code editor, and ensure that the `LittleLemonAPI` app contains the definition of the `MenuItem` model in the **models.py** file.

```Python
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class MenuItem(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    inventory = models.SmallIntegerField()

    def get_item(self):
        return f'{self.title} : {str(self.price)}'
```

Run the commands `makemigrations` and `migrate` to create the table structure.

To refresh your understanding of models and migrations, refer to these links:

- [Django Web Framework - Video: Creating models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/lecture/yAFex/creating-models)
- [Django Web Framework - Video: Migrations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/lecture/tMqae/migrations)
- [Django Web Framework - Reading: How to use migrations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/supplement/wcsZg/how-to-use-migrations)
- [Django Web Framework - Video: Working with migrations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/lecture/V0P1d/working-with-migrations)

## Serializers

The Django REST API needs a `serializer` class to convert the model instances into JSON format. Add a new module **serializers.py** in the app folder and declare the `MenuItemSerializer` class subclassing `ModelSerializer`.

## Views

To create the views you must subclass the `ListCreateView` that handles the HTTP GET and POST operations.

Similarly add a `SingleMenuItemView` class for PUT, GET and DELETE methods.

To recap different type of views in DRF follow these links:

- [APIs course - Video: Function and class-based Views](https://www.coursera.org/learn/apis/lecture/4BASB/function-and-class-based-views)
- [APIs course - Reading: Different types of routing in DRF](https://www.coursera.org/learn/apis/supplement/cFRCv/different-types-of-routing-in-drf)
- [APIs course - Reading: Generic views and ViewSets in DRF](https://www.coursera.org/learn/apis/supplement/AlxEs/generic-views-and-viewsets-in-drf)

## URLs

Declare the URL routes of the app.

```Python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('menu-items/', views.MenuItemsView.as_view()),
    path('menu-items/<int:pk>', views.SingleMenuItemView.as_view()),
]
```

Wire up the app's URLs with that of the project's URLConf.

```Python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from LittleLemonAPI import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/',include('LittleLemonAPI.urls'))
]
```

## Authentication

Your API is now ready. Visit `http://localhost:8000/api/menu-items` to test the POST and GET operations.

Next is the authentication part. The views that were added need no authentication.

Now it's time to add a view that will need authentication. 

This is done by mentioning **@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])** decorator above the function-based view. The following view displays a protected message.

```Python
#in views.py
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated

@api_view()
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
# @authentication_classes([TokenAuthentication])
def msg(request):
    return Response({"message":"This view is protected"})
```

Don't forget to update the app's URL configuration with URL route of the msg() view

```Python
urlpatterns = [
    path('menu-items/', views.MenuItemsView.as_view()),
    path('menu-items/<int:pk>', views.SingleMenuItemView.as_view()),
    path('message/', views.msg),
]
```

If you try to issue a GET request using the Insomnia client, you get the `'authentication credentials not provided'`. So, this view requires authentication.

![[Pasted image 20240923104159.png]]

Now go back to the admin panel and **obtain the token** for admin user.

![[Pasted image 20240923104210.png]]

Open the Insomnia app window and insert the token value to authenticate the request.

![[Pasted image 20240923104221.png]]

The `/api/message/` route now shows the desired response.

You can also obtain the token by visiting the following URL: `/api/'api-token-auth/`

Add this route in the app's urls.py file.

```Python
from django.urls import path
from rest_framework import routers
from . import views
from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token

urlpatterns = [
    path('menu-items/', views.MenuItemsView.as_view()),
    path('menu-items/<int:pk>', views.SingleMenuItemView.as_view()),
    path('message/', views.msg),
    path('api-token-auth/', obtain_auth_token)
]
```

Go to the Insomnia app and visit this URL. Enter username and password in the body.

![[Pasted image 20240923104759.png]]

You can also enforce authentication to the model view by adding the `IsAuthenticated` requirement in the view class.

```Python
class MenuItemsView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
  permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
  queryset = MenuItem.objects.all()
  serializer_class = MenuItemSerializer
```

The list of menu items will be displayed in the response window only after entering the token.

# [Exercise: Add the registration page](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/5qfSG/exercise-add-the-registration-page)

## **Overview**

So far, you have built the `Menu API` and `Table booking API` in your app.

In this exercise, you will add the feature of registering a new user in your Django project.

## **Scenario**

The objective of this exercise is to be able to add a new user, and modify the existing user's credentials from within the app instead of the admin interface. 

You will use the **Djoser** authentication library. Using the views defined in this library, you can easily implement registration, login and logout actions.

## Steps

**Step 1**

Install the `djoser` library in the current Django environment with PIP.

**Note:** You should already have Django REST framework installed.

**Step 2**

Add the code `'djoser'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the **settings.py** file. Ensure that it is placed after the `'rest_framework'` app in the list.

**Step 3**

Add a new section in the **settings.py** file to set the `DJOSER` variable.

```Python
#add the following line
DJOSER={"USER_ID_FIELD":"username"}
```

**Step 4**

Make sure that the `TokenAuthentication` and `SessionAuthentication` classes are added to the `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES` section in the `REST_FRAMEWORK` setting.

**Step 5**

Enable **djoser** endpoints by adding the following URL routes in the project's URL patterns.

```Python
#add following lines to update urlpatterns list
path('auth/', include('djoser.urls')),
path('auth/', include('djoser.urls.authtoken'))
```

**Step 6**

Run the migrations. Start the server and Login to the admin site with the superuser username and password. You should notice the **Tokens** section on the dashboard.

**Step 7**

Visit the `Browsable API URL User List` – Django REST framework to get the list of users already registered.

**Step 8**

Next you must register new user. To add a new user, use the form and submit a POST request.

![[Pasted image 20240923105114.png]]

**Step 9**

To login, visit the `djoser` generated URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/token/login/`.

Enter the username and password to obtain the token.

![[Pasted image 20240923105135.png]]

**Step 10**

To Logout, enter the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/token/logout/` with a POST method to logout the user.

## **Conclusion**

In this exercise, you used the `djoser` library to implement registration, login, and logout features.

# [Exercise: Securing the table booking API](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/1a376/exercise-securing-the-table-booking-api)

## Overview

In earlier exercises you already have the table booking API in the `Restaurant` app of your Django project with the name `LittleLemon`. 

In this exercise, you will add token-based authentication to secure the Table booking API.

## Scenario

When you enable token authentication feature in the app, a random hexadecimal string that is unique for each user can be generated from inside the admin panel as well as from within the app.

The HTTP client passes this token in the request header. You can then restrict a view only for authenticated users.

**Step 1**

Add the `'rest_framework.authtoken'` app to the list of `INSTALLED_APPS` in the **settings.py** file

**Step 2**

Import the `IsAuthenticated` class from the `rest_framework.permissions` module in the **views.py** file.

**Step 3**

You already have the `BookingViewSet` class in the **views.py** file. To secure this view, set the `permission_classes` property to a list containing `IsAuthenticated`.

```Python
permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
```

**Step 4**

Open the app's **urls.py** and import the following function:

```Python
#import obtain_auth_token view
from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token
```

In the same file add a new URL route to the `urlpatterns` list:

```Python
#add following line in urlpatterns list
path('api-token-auth/', obtain_auth_token)
```

**Step 5**

Run the server and visit the URL path `api-token-auth/` from the Insomnia client. You should select the POST method, and enter username and password in the body. When submitted, you get the token string as the response.

**Step 6**

To get the response from a secured URL, select the **Auth** tab in Insomnia, choose the **Bearer** token from the drop down, and enter the token generated in the previous step and then press the send button.

**Tips:**

To secure the view you need to set the `permission_classes` attribute. Follow the following example for the views in booking API.

```Python
from rest_framework.decorators import permission_classes
from rest_framework import generics
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
#set permission_classes attribute
from .models import MenuItem
class MenuItemsView(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
   permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
   queryset = MenuItem.objects.all()
   serializer_class = MenuItemSerializer
```

## Conclusion

In this exercise, you implemented the `TokenAutentication` feature of Django REST framework to secure table booking API.
