# [Recap: Version Control](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/305g8/recap-version-control)

## Introduction

Generally, a software product is developed in collaboration by a group of developers, each of whom is responsible for certain functionality of the product.

Everyone modifies the source code accordingly. However, suppose some change in the code results in a particular bug in the product. In that case, there must be a way to track the cause of the problem and seamlessly restore the state of the product to its previously working position.

## A Version Control System

A Version Control System (VCS) records changes to one or more files over time, so you can fall back to any specific version if required. Different types of version control mechanisms are employed.

A manual way is to store each version of source code files in separate folders, preferably with a time stamp, so that one can restore the state to the desired version. This approach can be very cumbersome and unsuitable for a collaborative development environment.

## Centralized version control system

In comparison, a centralized version control system works well. A single server stores the various versions of the source code. The administrator of the server controls the activity of the other collaborators.

However, if the server encounters any issues, there is a risk of losing all the work done.

Distributed version control system

The distributed version control system is far more reliable and efficient. In this system, each user has a local copy of the code called a repository.

During the development, developers make changes to the working copy of the repository and commit those changes to the local repository.

The changes in the local repository updated are then pushed to the central repository.

Changes from two or more independent branches and subsequently merged.

The merging or integration operation reconciles the multiple changes to a version-controlled file collection.

## Git

Git is a popular distributed version control system (DVCS). It's free and open-source software designed to manage all source code history.

You can keep a history of commits, revert to previous versions, and share code.

To collaborate with it, download and install Git on your machine from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

For example, open the Git terminal on your machine and initialize a local repository for the Little Lemon project.

```
$ git init littlelemon
```

**Add the project files to the folder and check the status**

```
$ cd littlelemon
$ git status
On branch master
 
No commits yet
```

**Add the files to the staging area of the repository**

```
$ git add .
```

**Configure the repository with relevant credentials**

```
$ git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

**Commit the files that have been added to the staging area**

```
$ git commit -m "first commit"
```

## GitHub

Usually, you store Git repositories on GitHub. It has the source control management (SCM) features of Git and some other features such as project management, support ticket management, and bug tracking.

Developers use GitHub to share their repositories, access other developers' repositories, and store remote copies of repositories to serve as backups.

Sign up to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and create a new repository on it.

Go back to the Git terminal and push the local repository to the GitHub repository.

## Summary

In this Reading, you learned what version control and Git is. You also learned how to create and push a local repository on GitHub.

# [Exercise: Setting up the repository](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/d682E/exercise-setting-up-the-repository)

## **Overview**

In this Capstone project, you need to upload your work on a GitHub repository. You will clone the GitHub repository to your machine, and push your code at the end of each exercise of this course.

## **Scenario**

In this exercise, you will create a repository on GitHub, clone it to a local repository, add a test file in it and commit the changes.

## **Prerequisites**

You should have completed Version control course to perform the steps in this exercise.

**Step 1:**

Download and install Git for your OS and architecture from [https://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download).

**Step 2**

Sign up for [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)and create a new repository. Name your repository as `LittleLemon`. Use the example shown below:

Make a new directory for the local repository.

```
$ mkdir littlelemon
```

**Step 6**

Enter the directory.

```
$ cd littlelemon
```

**Step 7**

Use the copied URL in the git clone command.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/malharSS/first-repo.git
```

![[Pasted image 20240921155008.png]]

**Step 8**

Enter the repository and check the list of files.

```

```

**Step 9**

Open a `newfile.txt` file with vi

```
$ vi newfile.txt
```

Save Hello World message text in it.

**Step 10**

Check the git status.

```
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        newfile.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

**Step 11**

Add the **newfile.txt** to the stage.

```
$ git add newfile.txt
```

**Step 12**

Commit the changes.

```
$ git commit -m "first commit"
```

**Step 13**

Check the status again.

```
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

**Step 14**

Push the changes.

```
$ git push origin main

# [Recap: Django Set Up](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/ArkIY/recap-django-set-up)

## Introduction

As you build a back-end application using Python's Django framework, you will need to have it installed on your machine. You need Python on your local machine to start. 

## Installing Python

If you don't already have it, download the appropriate installer for the operating system and your machine's architecture from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  

## Installing VS Code

It always helps to use an IDE to perform application development efficiently. You will be using VS Code while working on this Capstone project. Download and install VS Code from the official website [https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). 

Choose the appropriate installer depending on your operating system and architecture (32 bit or 64 bit).

## Setting up the virtual environment

Python recommends using separate virtual environments for each project to avoid a clash of dependencies of various projects. 

The standard method of creating a virtual environment is using the venv module in Python's standard library. 

It's important to remember that a virtual environment has its own copy of the Python interpreter and the library.

```
python –m venv c:\workspace
```

Enter this directory, activate the virtual environment, and start VS Code from inside it.

```
C:\workspace>scripts\activate 
(workspace) C:\workspace>code . 
```

Once inside VS Code, choose the Python interpreter of the current virtual environment.

## Installing Django

Open the command terminal, and install the Django framework by entering the following command in the terminal:

```
pip3 install django 
```

**Tip:** If you get stuck setting up your environment, revise the reading [Working with virtual environments](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/supplement/rZlSl/working-with-virtual-environments-on-your-local-machine "Working with virtual environments").

The installation command will install the Django framework, along with its dependencies.

To check if the installation is correctly installed, enter the following commands:

```
(workspace) C:\workspace>python 
Python 3.10.7 (tags/v3.10.7:6cc6b13, Sep  5 2022, 14:08:36) [MSC v.1933 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32 
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. 
>>> import django 
>>> django.__version__ 
'4.1.2' 
```

## Installing the Django REST Framework and mysqlclient libraries

Later in the course, you'll also need the **Django REST Framework** and **mysqlclient libraries**, so you must install them.

## Creating a Django project

You can quickly build a minimal Django project and see if it runs satisfactorily.

Use the `django-admin` command line utility to start a new Django project.

```
django-admin startproject littlelemon 
```

## Launching the development server

Step into the **littlelemon** directory, and use `manage.py` script to launch Django's development server.

```
(workspace) C:\workspace>cd littlelemon 
(workspace) C:\workspace\ littlelemon>python manage.py runserver 
Watching for file changes with StatReloader 
Performing system checks...

```

Open a new browser window and paste the localhost URL [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

![[Pasted image 20240921160150.png]]

A congratulations page should load in your browser, meaning Django has been installed successfully.

## Summary

In this Reading, you learned how to install a Django project and launch the development server.

# [Exercise: Setting up the Django project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/WLUcP/exercise-setting-up-the-django-project)

## **Overview**

In this Capstone project course, you are going to build REST APIs using Django and Django REST Framework.

In this exercise, you will build a Django project for the Little Lemon restaurant.

## **Scenario**

The owners of the Little Lemon restaurant have hired you to build two APIs. One API to order food using the `Menu API`. You need to build the `Table booking API` to facilitate reserving a table for dining in the restaurant on a specific date and for a certain number of people.

## Steps

**Step 1**

If your computer doesn’t already have Python installed on it, download and install from the link: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Tip: Make sure to choose the installer for your OS and architecture. 

**Step 2**

You will use VS Code for developing this Capstone project. If not already available locally, install from the link: [https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

**Step 3**

Create a Python virtual environment, activate it and install Django in it.

```
python –m venv workspace
cd workspace
scripts\activate
scripts\pip3 install django
```

**Note:** The **macOS** commands to activate virtual environment and install Django

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenvmyenv --python=python3
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install django
```

**Step 4**

Open VS code from the workspace directory

```
code .
```

**Step 5**

From VS Code extension marketplace, install the `Python` extension.

![[Pasted image 20240921160354.png]]

**Step 6**

Press `ctrl+shift+p` and select Python interpreter. Choose the interpreter in the virtual environment path.

**Step 7**

Open a new `CMD` terminal in VS Code. Use the `startproject` command of `django-admin` utility.

```
django-admin startproject littlelemon
```

**Note:** If the Powershell terminal opens by default, choose `Command Prompt` from the drop down

![[Pasted image 20240921160439.png]]

**Step 8**

Change the current directory to `littlelemon` and create a `djangoapp` with the name `restaurant`.

```
python manage.py startapp restaurant  
```

**Step 9**

Open the **settings.py** file from the `littlelemon` project package in a new VS Code window. Add the restaurant app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list.

**Step 10**

From the terminal, start the Django development server with following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

**Tip:** It’s safe to ignore the migration related warnings for now.

**Step 11**

Open the browser window and enter [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) URL. You should get the page showing the successful installation of Django project.

![[Pasted image 20240921160538.png]]

**Conclusion**

You have installed Django framework on your computer, and successfully created a Django project.

You have already cloned the GitHub repository to a local repository named `Capstone-project` in your machine's workspace directory.

You have also created a Django project with the name `LittleLemon`. Inside it, you created a Django app named `Restaurant`.

In this exercise, you will commit the project to the remote repository on GitHub.

## **Scenario**

For the capstone project, you will build a REST API for ordering food and table reservation.

## **Prerequisites**

You have set up a repository on GitHub and cloned it into the workspace directory. You should already have created a Django project called `Littlelemon` with an app named `Restaurant` in it.

## **Steps**

**Step 1: Create a new branch of local repository**

Open the terminal and use the command `git checkout –B <branch-name>` to create a new git branch. 

**Step 2: Add the project folder to the stage**

Enter the command `git add .`

**Step 3: Check the status**

In the Git terminal enter the `git status` command.

**Step 4: commit the changes**
