# [Recap: Unit Testing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/wz0Db/recap-unit-testing)

## Introduction

Testing is a vital part of the software development process. 

Before pushing the application to the production stage, validating it against the expected output is essential. 

Before you commit any change to the source code, it must be verified that your changes don't affect the application's behavior. 

A developer is always well advised to adopt an approach of test-driven development.

Django's testing framework provides the API to test your code and check if it is doing as expected. 

The test framework of Django is built upon the unit test package bundled with Python's standard library.

## Prerequisites

- Install Django and Django REST Framework in the current Python environment
- Create a Django project named `LittleLemon` with `django-admin` command
- Inside it, create a Django app with the name `LittleLemonAPI`
- Add the `'rest_framework'` and `'LittleLemonAPI'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list
- Run the `migrate` command

## Model

Define the `MenuItem` model in **LittleLemonAPI/models.py** file using the following code:

```Python
from django.db import models  

# Create your models here.  

class MenuItem(models.Model):  

    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)  
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)  
    inventory = models.SmallIntegerField()  

    def get_item(self):  
        return f'{self.title} : {str(self.price)}' 
```

## Serializer

Serialization is crucial in building an API with the Django REST Framework. It serializes the model instances into JSON format.

Use the `ModelSerializer` class to declare a `serializer` for the `MenuItem` model. Add the following code in the **LittleLemonAPI/serializers.py** file.

```Python
from rest_framework import serializers 
from .models import MenuItem  

class MenuItemSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer): 

    class Meta: 
        model = MenuItem 
        fields = ['id','title','price','inventory'] 
```

## Views

The next step is to provide the app with the view definitions. **DRF** has generic view classes. The **ListCreateAPIView** handles the POST and GET methods to add a model instance and retrieve all instances. Use it as a base for `MenuItemsView` class. 

**LittleLemonAPI/views.py**

```Python
from rest_framework import generics 
from .models import MenuItem 
from .serializers import MenuItemSerializer 

# Create your views here. 
class MenuItemsView(generics.ListCreateAPIView): 
    queryset = MenuItem.objects.all() 
    serializer_class = MenuItemSerializer 
```

# [Exercise: Adding unit tests](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/SWC0Z/exercise-adding-unit-tests)

## **Overview**

Testing is the process of validating the result of an operation against an expected output. Django’s test framework internally uses Python’s unit test package.

In this exercise, you will write the unit tests for satisfactory behavior of models and the views you have defined in the Menu API.

## **Scenario**

In your restaurant app, you already have built the `Menu API` and `Booking API`. You will write the model test in **test_models.py** and view test in **test_views.py files**.

**Step 1**

When you create the app, an empty **test.py** file is created in the app package folder. Go ahead and delete it.

In the project container folder, create a new folder with the name `tests`.

**Step 2**

Open the definition of the `Menu` model class.

Add a `__str__()` method that returns a string representation of the model instance.

```Python
#add the following method in Menu class
def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.title} : {str(self.price)}'
```

**Tip:** As you have made changes to the model, you must run the migrations to sync the changes.

**Step 3**

Create a new file in the **tests** folder named **test-models.py**.

Import the `TestCase` class from the `django.tests` module.

Use it as base and declare a test class, for example, `MenuTest`. 

Define an `instance` method that adds a new instance of the `Menu` model. 

Call the `assertEqual()` method of the test class that compares the string representation of the newly added object with the anticipated value.

For example:

```Python
#TestCase class
class MenuItemTest(TestCase):
    def test_get_item(self):
        item = MenuItem.objects.create(title="IceCream", price=80, inventory=100)
        self.assertEqual(item, "IceCream : 80")
```

**Step 4**

Open a command terminal in VS Code. While in the project container directory, run the test with the following command:

```
python manage.py test
```

Check the result of the test if it returns as `OK`.

**Step 5**

Open the **test_views.py** file in tests folder.

Write a `MenuViewTest` class that subclasses the `TestCase` class.

Use the `setup()` method to add a few test instances of the `Menu` model.

Next, add another `test_getall()` instance method to retrieve all the `Menu` objects added for the test purpose.

The retrieved objects must serialized, so make sure the method runs assertions to check if the serialized data equals the response.

Run the test again with the command `python manage.py test` and verify if the test returns as `OK`.

## **Conclusion**

In this exercise, you created and ran the unit tests to test the model and view for the `Menu` API.

# [Recap: Testing your API](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/ha4u5/recap-testing-your-api)

## Introduction

Before releasing the API to the end user, it is important that the developer test the API endpoints to check if the desired responses are obtained.

There are various API testing tools available, both for commercial use and as open-source apps. Insomnia is a free-to use tool for testing the REST API performance.

## Prerequisites

- Install Django and the Django REST Framework in the current Python environment.
- Create a Django project named `LittleLemon` using the `django-admin` command.
- Inside the Django project, create a Django app with the name `LittleLemonAPI`.
- Add the code `'rest_framework'`, and  `'LittleLemonAPI'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list inside the **settings.py** file.
- The views for the `Menu` API are defined, and its routes are configured.

## Install Insomnia

Insomnia is available as a browser extension for most of the popular browsers. However, it has limited functionality as compared to the desktop application. Hence, you should download and install Insomnia from  [https://insomnia.rest/download](https://insomnia.rest/download).

Launch the Insomnia app. You'll find three options in the top menu: **Design**, **Debug**, and **Test**. Make sure that the Debug option is active. 

You use the Design window to design API specification documents and the Test window to write the unit tests. It is from the Debug window that you visit the endpoints of your API and test the responses.

Make sure that your Django application is running. 

The insomnia interface is arranged in three panels. The left panel shows the requests issued so far. 

In the middle panel, you enter various parameters such as body parameters, query parameters, header, etc. 

Insomnia renders the responses in the right panel. 

Above the middle panel, you have a drop-down menu from which you can choose the type of HTTP request and a textbox to enter the URL.

The top of the right panel displays the response's status code. Here is a typical view of the Insomnia app:

![[Pasted image 20240923110600.png]]

You have defined the `SingleMenuItemView` class that handles `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE` requests for a given ID.

To test the functionality of retrieving a single menu item, change the URL by appending the item’s ID and send the request to the Django server. The response panel shows the details with 200 OK status code on top.

The `SingleMenuItemView` also preforms the POST request operations. Choose the POST option, enter the value for the model fields. On sending the request, new instance is added to the model.

![[Pasted image 20240923110624.png]]

You can confirm that a new instance is created, by visiting the `GET` endpoint again.

Similarly, you can test the `PUT` and DELETE requests with Insomnia.

If you have secured your API with the **token authorization** scheme, you will need to enter the **bearer token** in **Auth** tab. Obtain the token from the `api-token-auth/` endpoint.

![[Pasted image 20240923110647.png]]

Use the token for all the subsequent operations.

In this reading, you learned how to use Insomnia to test your DRF API.

# [Exercise: Testing the API using Insomnia](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-developer-capstone/supplement/OGeJJ/exercise-testing-the-api-using-insomnia)

## **Overview**

By now, you have the Django app with Menu API and table booking API built with Django REST framework, up and running. 

This is the final exercise of this course. In this exercise, you will use Insomnia to test your API.

## **Scenario**

You can perform CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE operations with the browsable API provided by the Django REST framework. However, Insomnia is a more versatile API client with a lot of useful functionality.

**Step 1**

Download and install the Insomnia client app from [https://insomnia.rest/download](https://insomnia.rest/download).

**Step 2**

Start the Django server.

Visit the browsable API URL of the Menu API to confirm the satisfactory functioning of the endpoints.

**Step 3**

Open the Insomnia app that you installed in the step 1.

**Step 4**

Create a new request. Enter the URL such as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items/`.

Choose the GET request.

In the responses panel, you will get the list of all the items in the Menu model.

**Step 5**

To add a new item through the Insomnia interface, change the request type to POST, keep the same URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items/`

Enter the details of the new item in JSON format.

![[Pasted image 20240923110804.png]]

**Step 6**

To update any existing item data, select the request type to PUT, append the item id to the URL – for example `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items/5`.

Enter the updated data for the item in JSON and send the request. The item is modified. You can confirm by issuing the GET request again.

**Step 7**

To test the DELETE operation, change the method type to DELETE, the URL should contain the id of the item to be deleted. Simply click the send button.

The item of the given id will be deleted from the model. To confirm, issue the GET request again.

## **Conclusion**

In this exercise, you tested the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE operations on your Menu API.
