## Student table:

![[Pasted image 20240503111907.png]]

```SQL
UPDATE student_tbl
SET home_address = '234 Park Avenue', contact_number = '23445555567'
WHERE ID = 3
```

### Update multiple students info

Let's suppose that the college's engineering department has moved their classes to a new location on campus called the Harper Building. And I need to update the department's address on the table for all engineering students. 

```SQL
UPDATE student_tbl
SET college_address = 'Harper Building'
WHERE department = 'engineering'
```

```SQL
UPDATE student_tbl
SET college_address = 'Harper Building', home_address = 'xyz'
WHERE department = 'engineering'
```
