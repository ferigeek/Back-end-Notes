# [Regular expressions in URLs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/lecture/sVWFw/regular-expressions-in-urls)

Django lets you design URLs however you want, and you do this by using the path function and path converters.

For example, creating a custom URL with dynamic values for more complex matching requirements, you can define your own path converters using something called regular expressions. 

```Python
urlpatterns = [
	re_path(r'^menu_item/([0-9]{2})/$', views.display_menu_item),
]
```

Suppose you have been tasked to create a menu item page for the Little Lemon website. The page displays content for each item on the menu. Instead of making a specific page for each menu item, you can define the dynamic URL structure that will pass the menu item ID to the view function. 

The content of the page will depend on the menu item value past to the view function from the URL. Based on the ID value pasta in the URL, the logic in the view function will determine what type of data to display, like a menu item name. 

The advantage for developers is that they only need to create one page. Instead of creating individual static pages for each menu item, developers only need to create one page whose content updates dynamically based on the values past in the URL. 

However, to ensure that the URLs structured in the way that the view function requires, you need a way to define and verify the values and format of the URL. To verify that the URL values pasta to the view function are correct, you can use ==regular expressions==. 

## RegEx

> [!INFO] RegEx
> Regular expressions or RegEx, are a set of characters that specify a pattern and are used to search for or find patterns in a string. They are a powerful tool that developers use to perform ==extraction== and ==validation==, ==advanced searching==, ==group searches==, and ==find and replace operations==. 

In django, developers use regular expressions to define, extract and validate dynamic URL paths before they are sent to the associated view function. 

However, it's important to know that regular expressions are not specific to python or Django. They have many uses across various areas of computer programming and software development.

> [!WARNING] 
> Regular expressions and their associated characters are universal, meaning they are the same across all programming languages. 

```Python
# urls.py (app)

from django.urls import path, re_path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
	path('menu_item/10', views.display_menu_item),
	re_path(r'^menu_item/([0-9]{2})/$', views.display_menu_item),
]
```

Notice that the first path contains the URL string of `menu_item/10`. This string is ==static== and ==immutable==, which means it has no possible numerical variations even if in the same format. 

For example if you enter a URL such as `menu_item/01`, it will not match this path and map to the view. As a result a 404 not found error message will be displayed. 

You can accept all URLs in this format using the regular expression path function like in the second entry.

> [!WARNING]
> Notice the character r at the beginning, this makes a row string which treats the back slashes symbols as literal characters and not escape characters. 

### Common symbols used

- ^ : Caret symbol used as the anchor at the start of the string, it can also be used for negation. 
- & : Dollar symbol which is used as the anchor for the end of the string.
- [] : You use opening and closing square brackets to define a character set that matches any one of the characters present inside. 
- {} : Opening and closing curly brackets are used to specify the exact number of proceeding characters. 
- () : Opening and closing parenthesis are used for grouping parts of the RegEx. 

Acceptable strings for this RegEx can be menu item forward slash followed by the range 1 to 99. 

Regular expressions are extremely useful while creating you URLs, but at the same time they can often get complex. And this is especially true for regular expressions containing several special characters. 

It's common for aspiring developers to feel confused when first learning regular expressions. Sometimes a symbol can be used for one or more purposes or the same symbol can behave differently depending on the case. Getting familiar with their usage requires some practice and a little patience.

# [URL Namespacing and Views](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/supplement/9Bl6F/url-namespacing-and-views)

This reading explains the use of named URLs in the `URLconf` of a Django app and how the use of a namespace helps in resolving the same URL name in more than one app.

In each app, there is a `urls.py` file that defines the list of URL patterns for that app. Each pattern is constructed by `django.urls.path()` function. Its arguments are a URL path string, the name of the view function to be mapped to it and an optional argument name.

The following is the `urls.py` of an app:

```Python
#demoapp/urls.py 
from django.urls import path 
from . import views 

  urlpatterns = [ 
    path('', views.index, name='index'), 
    path('login/', views.login, name='login') 
] 
```

It is included in the project’s `urlpatterns`.

```Python
from django.contrib import admin 
from django.urls import path, include 

  urlpatterns = [ 
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls), 
    path('demo/', include('demoapp.urls')), 
] 
```

Normally, the client’s request URL is mapped against the function so that the application flow is directed toward it. 

The URL references used internally by the application are hard-coded strings. 

For example, a form template’s action attribute points towards `/demoapp/login` URL so that when the form is submitted, the login view mapped to this URL is invoked.

```
<form action='/demoapp/login', method='POST> 
    # ...
</form> 
```

## reverse() function

However, the hard-coded URLs make the application less scalable and difficult to maintain as the project grows. In such a case, you can obtain the URL from the name parameter used in the `path()` function.

Start the Django shell.

```Python
python manage.py shell 
```

Django’s `reverse()` function returns the URL path to which it is mapped.

```Shell
>>> from django.urls import reverse 
>>> reverse('index') 
'/demo/' 
```

The problem comes when the view function of the same name is defined in more than one app. This is where the idea of a `namespace` is needed.

## Application namespace

The application namespace is created by defining `app_name` variable in the application’s `urls.py` and assigning it the name of the app. In the `demoapp/urls.py` script, make the change using the following code:

```Python
#demoapp/urls.py
from django.urls import path  
from . import views    
app_name='demoapp' 
urlpatterns = [  
    path('', views.index, name='index'),      
] 
```

The `app_name` defines the application namespace so that the views in this app are identified by it.

To obtain the URL path of the `index()` function, call the `reverse()` function by prepending the namespace to it.

```Shell
>>> reverse('demoapp:index') 
'/demo/' 
```

To appreciate the advantage of defining a namespace, add another app in the project, for example, `newapp`. Provide an `index()` view function in it and define `app_name` in its `URLConf` file (that is `urls.py`).

```Python
#newapp/urls.py 
from django.urls import path 
from . import views 
app_name='newapp' 
urlpatterns = [ 
    path('', views.index, name='index'), 
] 
```

Update the project’s `urls.py`.

```Python
from django.contrib import admin 
from django.urls import path, include 

urlpatterns = [ 
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls), 
    path('demo/', include('demoapp.urls')), 
    path('newdemo/', include('newapp.urls')), 
] 
```

The `reverse()` function is executed for index view in `newapp` namespace.

```Shell
>>> reverse('newapp:index') 
'/newdemo/' 
```

You can see that Django differentiates between same-named URLs in multiple apps with application namespace.

## Instance namespace

You can also use the namespace parameter in the `include()` function while adding an app’s `urlpattern` to that of a project.

```Python
#in demoproject/urls.py 
urlpatterns=[ 
    # ... 
    path('demo/', include('demoapp.urls', namespace='demoapp')), 
    # ... 
] 
```

This namespace is called the `instance namespace`.

## Using namespace in view

Suppose you want the user to be conditionally redirected to the login view from inside another view. You need to obtain the URL of the login view and send the control to it with `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect`.

```Python
from django.http import HttpResponsePermanentRedirect 
from django.urls import reverse 
  
def myview(request): 
    .... 
    return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(reverse('demoapp:login'))
```

## namespace in the `url` tag

An HTML form is submitted to the URL specified in the action attribute.

```HTML
<form action="/demoapp/login" method="post"> 

#form attributes 

<input type='submit'> 

</form> 
```

The form will then be processed by the view mapped to this URL. However, as mentioned above, a hard-coded URL is not desired. Instead, use the `url` tag of the Django Template Language. It returns the absolute path from the named URL. 

Use the `url` tag to obtain the URL path dynamically, as shown below:

```HTML
<form action="{% url 'login' %}" method="post"> 
#form attributes 
<input type='submit'> 
</form> 
```

Again, the login view may be present in multiple apps. Use the named URL qualified with the namespace to resolve the conflict.

```HTML
<form action="{% url 'demoapp:login' %}" method="post"> 
#form attributes 
<input type='submit'> 
</form> 
```

The browser shows the login form as below:

![[lyoNkV0pTDufhWIoe8bRhQ_0bedde03463c4fc8940cdb5d162364e1_C5M2L3_Itm02_1.png]]

Thus, the concept of namespace helps in resolving the conflict arising out of multiple apps under the same project having views of the same name.

You have covered some of the concepts here in line with the use of form templates in Django. If you have difficulty understanding some things, be assured it will be much more clear once you cover the topic of templates in this course.

In this reading, you further explored the concept of URL Namespacing and Views in Django.

# [Error Handling](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/lecture/af42g/error-handling)

An application will contain errors in some form no matter how much testing or QA is performed. This is not always directly related to incorrect code or syntax issues By their very nature networks are not always 100% reliable and things can occasionally go wrong as an aspiring developer. 

## More common status codes

### Client Error

-  400 : which represents a bad request. This occurs when parameters passed in the request are not what the server may expect. 
-  401 : which indicates that the user must log into an account before processing the request.
-  403 : indicating that the request was valid but that the Web server refuses to process it. This typically means that the user calling the resource does not have the required permissions to view the resource. 
- 404 : indicates that the requested resource was not found on the web server. This typically happens when the resource cannot be located at the specified file path. 

### Server Error

Server or responses usually indicate a failure occurred on the web server while trying to process the request. This can mean many things. For example, the application has failed or is not running or the time limit on the calling request may have aborted due to the server taking a long time to respond

- 500 : internal server error which is a generic error status indicating that the server failed to process the request. 

## How django handles errors

Django handles all our cases by raising an exception which is invoked via an error handling view that you can configure. These are handling views are added to a separate views, That pie file that must be created at the project level to get applied across the project. 

```Python
# views.py (project)

from django.http import HttpResponse

def handler404(request, exception):
	return HttpResponse("404: Page not Found!")

def home(request):
	return HttpResponse("Little Lemon!")
```

The views to use for these cases are specified by four variables. They are: 
- handler400
- handler403 
- handler404
- handler500 

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to know that while you can use the default values and views for
> your projects, there may be times when you want to customize the look of
> these views to align with the style or theme of your site.

Further customization is possible by overriding the default values. Such values can be set in the root U R L configuration file of your project. It's important to know that setting these variables in any other URL configuration file will have ==no effect==. 

```Python
# urls.py (project)

handler400 = 'my_project.views.handler400'
handler403 = 'my_project.views.handler403' # full python import path to the view
handler404 = 'my_project.views.handler404'
handler500 = 'my_project.views.handler500'
```

The first is handler 400 by default. This is the bad request view. Next is handler 403 by default. This is the permission denied view Next is Handler 404 by default. This is the page not found view finally, handler 500 by default. This is the server error view. 

The view function needs to accept the appropriate request argument and return the appropriate response. The custom views that you create using these handlers return different http response sub classes that handle different types of http responses.

- Class HttpResponseNotFound, Acts just like http response but uses a 404 status code 
- Class HttpResponseBadRequest acts just like http response, but uses a 400 status code 
- Class HttpResponseForbidden acts just like http response, but uses a 403 status code 
- Class HttpResponseServerError acts just like http response, but uses a 500 status code

# [Handling Errors in Views](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/supplement/QpaMm/handling-errors-in-views)

In a Django application, a view function is where all the processing is done.

It receives the request and formulates the response.

In this Reading, you’ll learn how Django handles runtime errors or exceptions.

The response from the view is an object of `HttpResponse`. Its contents are also associated with a respective status code.

For example, status code **404** implies that the resource requested by the client cannot be found. Django has a generic `HttpResponseNotFound` class. You can return its object to convey the appropriate message.

```Python
from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseNotFound 
def my_view(request): 
    # ... 
    if condition==True: 
        return HttpResponseNotFound('<h1>Page not found</h1>') 
    else: 
        return HttpResponse('<h1>Page was found</h1>') 
```

You can also return a `HttpResponse` with the status code denoting the type of error.

```Python
from django.http import HttpResponse 
def my_view(request): 
    # ... 
    if condition==True: 
        return HttpResponse('<h1>Page not found</h1>', status_code='404') 
    else: 
        return HttpResponse('<h1>Page was found</h1>') 
```

The main difference in using `HttpResponseNotFound` as opposed to `HttpResponse` that must be understood is that Django internally sends an error code **404.** The appropriate page for 404 can then be configured and rendered, else the browser displays its default **404** view.

A common cause of the **404** status code is the user entering an incorrect URL.

Django makes it easy to work with this error code.

Put a string argument inside the `HttpResponseNotFound()` to view the error message. Instead, raise `Http404`. Django displays a standard error page with the status.

(Instead, raise `Http404` exception).

Consider the following scenario, where you have a `Product` model in the app.

The user wants the details of a product with a specific Product ID.

In the following view function, `id` is the parameter obtained from the URL.

It tries to determine whether any product with the given id is available. If not, the `Http404` exception is raised.

```Python
from django.http import Http404, HttpResponse 
from .models import Product 

def detail(request, id): 
    try: 
        p = Product.objects.get(pk=id) 
    except Product.DoesNotExist: 
        raise Http404("Product does not exist") 
    return HttpResponse("Product Found") 
```

Just like the `HttpResponseNotFound`, there are a number of other predefined classes such as `HttpResponseBadRequest`, `HttpResponseForbidden` and so on.

## Custom error pages

If you want to show your own error page whenever the user encounters a **404** error, you must create a **404.html** page and put it in the project/templates folder.

You will learn more about how to do this later when you explore templates.

## Displaying error messages in the browser

Usually, the Django development server is in `DEBUG` mode, which shows the error's traceback instead of the exception.

![[mD581mArRJCsELIvxaYGLw_b254e91193f547dab43a98f8f271c9e1_C5M2L3_Itm08_1.png]]

To render the custom exception message, the DEBUG variable in the project’s settings should be set to False.

```Python
#settings.py  

# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!  
  
DEBUG=FALSE 
```

![[PdgJILp0SfylYcwIzBqUdA_ac04e5ecf0be4396aac48218e28bf8e1_C5M2L3_Itm08_2.png]]

## Exception classes

Django’s exception classes are defined in the `django.core.exceptions` module. 

Some important exception types are:

- `ObjectDoesNotExist`: All the exceptions of the `DoesNotExist` are inherited from this base exception.
- `EmptyResultSet`: This exception is raised if a query does not return any result.
- `FieldDoesNotExist`: This exception is raised when the requested field does not exist.

```Python
try: 
    field = model._meta.get_field(field_name) 
except FieldDoesNotExist: 
    return HttpResponse("Field Does not exist") 
```

- `MultipleObjectsReturned`: When you expect a certain query to return only a single object, however multiple objects are returned. This is when you need to raise this exception.
- `PermissionDenied`: This exception is raised when a user does not have permission to perform the action requested.

```Python
def myview(request): 
    if not request.user.has_perm('myapp.view_mymodel'): 
        raise PermissionDenied() 
    return HttpResponse() 
```

- `ViewDoesNotExist`: This exception is raised by `django.urls` when a requested view does not exist, possibly because of incorrect mapping defined in the `URLconf`. 

When a certain view is called with a **POST** or **PUT** request, the request body is populated by the form data. 

Django’s Form API defines various fields specific to the type of data stored. For example, you have `EmailField`, `FileField`, `IntegerField`, `MultipleChoiceField`. 

These fields have built-in validators. The `is_valid()` method returns **True** if the validations are passed. You can raise an exception if it returns False.

```Python
def myview(request):   
    if request.method == "POST":   
        form = MyForm(request.POST)   
        if form.is_valid():   
            #process the form data 
        else:   
                return HttpResponse("Form submitted with invalid data") 
```

In addition to the exceptions defined in the core module, you can process the standard Python exceptions and the database-related exceptions.

In this reading, you learned how to handle errors inside the Django view.

# [Demo: Handle errors in views](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/lecture/bYSvR/demo-handle-errors-in-views)

Recall that Django displays a page not found error page when a URL cannot be matched. This default error page displays with some technical information for the developer, including the request method and request URL.

However, you usually do not want your end-users to access this type of information, as these types of error messages will mean nothing to them. Instead, you can create a custom view for the error page. 

Let's begin by running a server first, by typing python3managed.py run server. Next, open the local host URL in your browser and notice the default page loads. If you enter some URL, let's say home. Notice that a page not found error page is displayed by default. The page contains some error information and a message stating; you're seeing this error because you have DEBUG =True in the Django settings file. Change that to false, and Django will display a standard 404 page. 

> [!INFO] Debugging
> Debugging is the process of handling errors in code. 

In Django, debug mode is set to true by default, which displays detailed error pages during development. 

To apply this change, open the `settings.py` file under the my project and change the debug value to false. 

> [!WARNING]
> Additionally, you must add some value inside allowed host. In this example, add the star symbol to include all possible hosts. 

## Custom view for the Error

To do this, you must create a new file called `views.py` at the project level. Once created, open the `urls.py` file and update the code with the necessary imports and URL patterns. Additionally, you must add another URL pattern ==outside== the URL patterns sequence. 

Create the view location `myproject.views.handler404` and assign it to a variable called `handler404`. 

```Python
handler404 = 'myproject.views.handler404'
```

Next, go to the views.py file inside the project folder and import `HttpResponse`. Create a view with the name handler404 as referenced previously. Inside the function, pass the request object and an exception argument. Then return the HTTP response object with some text value such as 404 call on Page not Found. 

```Python
# views.py (project level)

from django.http import HttpResponse

def handler404(request, exception):
    return HttpResponse("404 : Page not found! ")
```

Similarly, just as the code uses the `HttpResponse` object, you can also use `HttpResponseNotFound`. Different classes in Django represent different status codes. The HTTP response not found class represents status code 404 Page not Found. 

> [!TIP]
> It's generally considered best practice to create a custom error page that's easy to understand, consistent with the website's branding, and directs users back to the homepage.

# [Class-based views](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/lecture/BxGIU/class-based-views)

Organizing your code in a clean and easy to use manner is essential when working on a project. As the project grows, keeping code organized and well structured can be a challenge for developers.

To help overcome these challenges, developers often use frameworks and design patterns such as MVT. For example, with the Django framework, you can use views to present data to the end users. 

In the background, the framework passes that HTTP request to your function expecting the HTTP response back. While this works for some use cases, developers often need a more robust solution for implementing more complicated application logic in a view. 

To help with this, Django provides something called a class based view.

## Features of class based views

Class based views allow you to use views as objects and offer an alternative to function based views. Remember that a view is callable in that it can take a request and return a response. This process works great for the HTTP protocol. When dealing with HTTP, you use specific methods for the different types of requests. Such as get, post, put and delete and these are the core CRUD operations for any web page. 

If you use a function based view, you need to perform some conditional logic on the request method, like an if else statement. But class based views, uses a different approach than function based views. Instead of using conditional branching, such as if else statements, class based views respond to HTTP requests using class instance methods. Instance methods are default python methods, defined in classes that can access objects or ==instances== of a class.

In a class based view, this can be simplified by adding different instance methods for the get and post requests. And these methods will implement the view logic independently. 

```Python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views import View

class MyView(View):
	def get(self, request):
		# <view logic>
		return HttpResponse('result')
	def post(self, request):
		# <view logic>
		return HttpsResponse('result')
```

Class based views, respond with different class instance methods to HTTP requests in place of writing conditional branches, such as using if else, statements inside the same function. 

```Python
# View (function)

def my_view(request):
	if request.method == 'GET':
		# <view logic>
		return HttpsResponse('result')
```

```Python
# View (class)

class MyView(View):
	def get(self, request):
		# <view logic>
		return HttpsResponse('result')
```

The advantage of using a class based view in this scenario, is that it allows you to remove the conditional logic to check the incoming request for the type of method. This simplifies the code and separates the logic, making it easy to understand. 

Another helpful aspect is the ability to have object oriented techniques, such as mixins or multiple inheritance, which factor code into reusable components. 

In Django, you can extend the functionality of class based views using mixins. 

> [!INFO] Mixins
> Mixins are class based generic views that are flexible compared to their function based view equivalent. It can help to think of a mixin as a form of multiple inheritance.

Recall that inheritance as one of the core concepts of object oriented design or OOP. It allows you to derive one class from another for a hierarchy of classes with similar attributes. For example, suppose you have a class called food. Other classes that can inherit from this class could be appetizers, entree and desserts. 

They are all types of food and would share a lot of common attributes. Some common mixins developers use are create, list, retrieve, update and delete.

- Use create to create a model instance
  `class MenuCreate(CreateView):`
- Use list to list a query set
  `class MenuList(ListView):`
- Use retrieve to retrieve a model instance
  `class MenuDetailView(ListView):`
- Use update to update a model instance
  `class MenuUpdateView(UpdateView):`
- Use delete to delete a model instance
  `class MenuDeleteView(DeleteView):`
  

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to note that when using mixins, they can't be all used together. And in some cases it can make your code harder to read. So, it's best to use them wisely.
