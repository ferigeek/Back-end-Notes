# [Debugging Django applications](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/lecture/H4Ffy/debugging-django-applications)

> [!INFO] Debugging
> Debugging is the process of identifying and isolating an error, finding the source, and deploying measures to solve the problem. 

While making mistakes is a part of programming, correcting errors inside a web framework, such as Django can be particularly difficult. 

Unlike errors occurring in a standalone file that can be easily spotted, web projects consists of several interlinked files and dependencies that can make troubleshooting challenging. 

While debugging takes patience, it also helps build a better understanding of the internal working of an application. 

Mistakes can happen in many forms and at any stage of the development process. These can include :

- missing adding a view 
- creating incorrect templates 
- missing import statements 
- inaccessible resources such as model data 
- or even missing a comma in some attributes passed inside a function

As a beginner, seeing the errors and having to troubleshoot can be intimidating. While observation and hands-on practice with web applications are the best means to overcome errors in Django projects, there are tools available that can speed up the process of getting a project up and running.

You already know how to raise a few errors using provided internal implementations. But there are unforeseen errors that occur that also needs to be attended to. 

Django has a distinct debugger that appears in the form of a yellow page arrow. You may recall seeing the debug equals true flag on the homepage of the local host after running the server. The Django debugger is enabled by default, and settings for it  an be found and modified inside the `settings.py` file of your project.

While it is a useful component of development, the developers of Django recommend that it should never be used in the production environment. This is because it may expose internal file parts, as well as database and project configuration details to the end user using your website.

This can be prevented by changing the setting to debug equals false. 

Other than the default debugger provided by Django, Django, as you know is written in Python and can easily integrate third party libraries that help in debugging.

Let's now examine a few ways in which you can debug Django applications. This example uses the creating forms project demonstrated earlier. 

Immediately, you'll notice there is a 404 page not found error and this is because you haven't configured the URL for the local host. Also, notice that this displays in the console in the logger. 

> [!NOTE]
> It's important to know that the default Django implementation enlists all the steps that Django has performed after you run the command. 

Let's now go to the correct URL. Notice that the logs update at the bottom inside the console. 

Now, open the forms.py file. Python specific errors will most likely occur in the console log. For example, if you comment out the shifts constant and save the file, notice an error log displays inside the console. The name error displays with the text, name shift is not defined. If you try to refresh the local host URL in the browser, notice that the page will not load. 

However, some other errors are not that obvious. For example, remove the import you passed inside the log form and save the file. Notice that you do not get any error in the log. However, if you refresh the web page, notice that the template for the form disappears except for the submit button that was rendered using static HTML markup. 

To prevent this from happening, always ensure you have the right imports and that you pass the correct arguments inside functions. 

Let's say you open the file, my template `home.html`. Inside the file, remove the code for the CSRF token and save the file. If you go to the local host URL and reload the page, notice that the forms render correctly. Fill out the form and press the submit button. Notice that an error displays stating, forbidden CSRF verification failed. This error specifies that the CSRF token is missing, which is helpful for troubleshooting. 

> [!TIP]
> You can broadly say the yellow page errors are more specific to problems inside Django than Python code.

Now, let's say you go to the files.py file again and misconfigure the template you are trying to render. Let's say you call this `home_page.html` and save it again. Once you go to a template page, you get an error such as template does not exist in the particular path. 

![[Pasted image 20240821193752.png]]

First, it specifies the exception location, and you can get a hint from get template and how it is raised during form view. 

Next, if you keep scrolling, you get a stack, which is called the trace back stack. It contains Python code in sequential order with a particular line highlighted, which will likely be the place of the error. 

![[Pasted image 20240821193854.png]]

You can also convert this to ==switch to copy and paste view==. When you change this, you get a much cleaner interface, mentioning all the details. 

You can additionally click on, share this trace back on a public website, which when clicked, will take you to debase.com. This page displays convenient clipboard content that you can share on different forums. 

If you scroll down further, there's information about the dictionary containing all available HTTP header information called meta. 

On further scrolling, you can find details inside the settings and all of these are potentially helpful. 

> [!TIP]
> Regarding debugging, you can never apply a one rule for all approach. With practice, the number of errors you encounter will slowly decrease. A systematic and patient approach in dealing with these projects is the best way forward.

# [Testing in Django](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/lecture/lHI6q/testing-in-django)

Testing is an important component in the software development lifecycle. While debugging is more driven towards removing the application's errors and bugs, testing considers metrics for quality, reliability and performance.

Every language and framework has many testing options and developers make appropriate selections based on the project's requirements. 

## Unit test

A popular method is ==unit testing==, which you can use to isolate a function class or method and only test that piece of code. 

When working with unit testing, you need the following baseline information:

First, the test targets granular features in your code, the smallest possible testable units. Then the output of the test will be pass fail or an error.

In Django. The unit test module uses a class based approach. You add the tests inside a class that inherits a class called test case from the Django test package. 

```Python
from django.test import TestCase
```

Suppose you wrote a model called reservation and want to test it. First import that `TestCase` class that inherits test case, then import the reservation model. 

```Python
from django.test import TestCase
from myapp.models import Reservation

class ReservationTestCase(TestCase):

	def createReservation(self):
		Reservation.objects.create(name="John", seat_count=4, time_entry=10:10)

	def test_seat_count(self):
		"""The seat count is ensured to be less than 8"""
		customer = Reservation.objects.get(name="John")
		# insert Assertion to test condition
```

Once you create the tests, use the command :

```Terminal
python3 manage.py test
```

Additionally, you can add specific configurations to ==run all tests within a specific package==. For example, run the command:

```Terminal
python3 manage.py test reservations
```

To run a ==specific test case==, use the command:

```Terminal
python3 manage.py test reservations.tests.ReservationTestCase
```

Our suppose you want to run a ==specific test method== inside a test case, for example, a method to calculate the seat count. You can run the command like:

```Terminal
python3 manage.py test reservations.tests.ReservationTestCase.test_seat_count
```

> [!TIP]
> It's important to know that developers generally add these test cases under one or more files created under specific app folders. In a ==small project== it's common for developers to name the file `tests.py`. In large projects that may contain multiple test files, it's common for developers to use names like `test_models.py` and `test_views.py`. 

## Example 

```Python
# models.py

from django.db import models

class Reservation(models.Model):

	first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
	last_name - models.CharField(max_length=100)
	booking_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

	def __str__(self):
		return self.first_name
```

The ==`auto_now`== field inside the booking time logs the system's current time and is set to true.

```Python
# tests.py

from django.test import TestCase
from datetime import datetime
from .models import Reservation

class ReservationModelTest(TestCase):

	def setUpTestData(cls):
		cls.reservation = Reservation.objects.create(
			first_name = "John"
			last_name = "McDonald"
		)

	def test_fields(self):
		self.assertIsInstance(self.reservation.first_name, str)
		self.assertIsInstance(self.reservation.last_name, str)

	def test_timestamps(self):
		self.assertIsInstance(self.reservation.booking_time, datetime)
```

`setUpTestData` is a method present inside the test case that you use to add data inside the model. So in this example data is entered for the first name and the last name. It is important to know that booking time automatically updates as the `auto_now` parameter is set to true.

You perform the check using the assert statements to check both the first name and last name are of the string data type. 

```Terminal
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

> [!WARNING]
> The final part of this step is to remember to add the `classmethod` decorator; Since this is a class method. 

```Python
# tests.py

from django.test import TestCase
from datetime import datetime
from .models import Reservation

class ReservationModelTest(TestCase):

	@classmethod
	def setUpTestData(cls):
		cls.reservation = Reservation.objects.create(
			first_name = "John"
			last_name = "McDonald"
		)

	def test_fields(self):
		self.assertIsInstance(self.reservation.first_name, str)
		self.assertIsInstance(self.reservation.last_name, str)

	def test_timestamps(self):
		self.assertIsInstance(self.reservation.booking_time, datetime)
```

```Terminal
python manage.py test
```

# [Sub-classing Generic Views](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/supplement/usxgu/sub-classing-generic-views)

In this reading, you’ll learn about the `class_based` generic views.

You can implement the view layer with function or class-based views in a Django application. You declare a class by extending the `django.views.View` class and define `get()` and `post()` methods inside it to handle the HTTP requests. The URL pattern connects the path to the class with the `as_view()` method of the View class. 

A quick example of class view:

```Python
from django.views import View   
class NewView(View):   
    def get(self, request):   
        # View logic will place here   
        return HttpResponse('response') 
```

The URL pattern in `urls.py` is updated as below:

```Python
#urls.py 
from myapp.views import NewView   
urlpatterns = [   
    path('about/', NewView.as_view()),   
]  
```

Django provides class-based generic views to make the development process much easier and faster. In this reading, you’ll discover how the generic views are implemented.

The most frequently used generic views are:

- TemplateView
- CreateView 
- ListView
- DetailView 
- UpdateView 
- DeleteView
- LoginView

## Difference between Function View and generic view

Let's take a simple example of rendering a Hello world template. You should render the template as the HTTP response – the return value of the function. The view function for this purpose would be as follows:

```Python
from django.shortcuts import render 
from django.http import HttpResponse 
def index(request): 
    template = loader.get_template('myapp/index.html') 
    context={} 
    return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request)) 
```

As you may have already learned, the app package folder exists inside the project's outer container folder. The `myapp` app is created in the Django project named `myproject`.

In the `myapp/urls.py`, define the URL pattern:

```Python
path('/', views.index, name='index') 
```

You can include the URL definitions of `myapp` in the project's URL configuration:

```Python
urlpatterns = [ 
    . . . , 
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')) 
]   
```

Use a `TemplateView` class instead. Simply define a class extending it and set the `template_name` attribute.

```Python
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView 

class IndexView(TemplateView): 
    template_name = 'index.html' 
```

The corresponding URL pattern should incorporate this:

```Python
path('/', IndexView.as_view(), name='index') 
```

## Advantage of function-based views

- Simple to implement.
- Easy to read.
- Explicit code flow.
- Straightforward usage of decorators.
- good for one-off or specialized functionality.

## Disadvantages of function-based views

- Hard to extend and reuse the code.
- Handling of HTTP methods via conditional branching.

## Advantages of Class-based views

- Code reusability.
- DRY — Using CBVs help to reduce code duplication.
- Code can be extended to include more functionalities.
- class with different methods for each http request instead of conditional branching statements inside a single function-based view.
- Built-in generic class-based views.

## Disadvantages of Class-based views

- Harder to read.
- Implicit code flow.
- Use of view decorators require extra import or method override.

## Requirements of a generic view

- If the view needs a model to be processed, it should be set as the value of model property of the view.
- Each type of view looks for a template name with `modelname` suffixed by the type of generic view. For example, for a list view processing employee model, Django tries to find `employee_list.html`.
- The generic view is mapped with the URL with `as_view()` method of the View class.

Let's now build a subclass for each of the respective generic view classes to perform CRUD operations on the Employee model:

```Python
class Employee(models.Model):   
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)   
    email = models.EmailField()   
    contact = models.CharField(max_length=15)   
    class Meta:   
        db_table = "Employee" 
```

## CreateView

The `CreateView` class automates the creation of a new instance of the model. To provide a create view, use the sub-class of `CreateView`:

```Python
from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView   

class EmployeeCreate(CreateView):   
    model = Employee    
    fields = '__all__' 
    success_url = "/employees/success/" 
```

A model form based on the model structure is created by this view and passed to the `employeeCreate.html` template:

```HTML
<form method="post"> 
{% csrf_token %} 
<table> 
    {{ form.as_table }} 
</table> 
    <input type="submit" value="Save"> 
</form> 
```

The URL path is updated by mapping the `"create/"` path to the `as_view()` method of this class:

```Python
from .views import EmployeeCreate 
urlpatterns = [ 
    . . . 
    path('create/', EmployeeCreate.as_view(), name = 'EmployeeCreate')  , 
] 
```

When the client visits this URL, they are presented with the form. The user fills and submits the employee details, which are saved in the Employee table.

## ListView

Django's `django.views.generic.list` module contains the definition of `ListView` class. Write its sub-class to render the list of model objects.

The `EmployeeList` class is similar to the `CreateView` sub-class except its base class.

```Python
from django.views.generic.list import ListView  
class EmployeeList(ListView):   
    model = Employee   
    success_url = "/employees/success/" 
```

The template required for this view must be named `employee_list.html`. Django sends the model object in its context. Using the DTL loop syntax, you can display the list of employees:

```HTML
<ul>   
        {% for object in object_list %}   
        <li>Name: {{ object.name }}</li>   
        <li>Email: {{ object.email }}</li>   
        <li>contact: {{ object.contact }}</li>  
        <br/> 
        {% endfor %}   
</ul> 
```

If the user visits [http://localhost:/8000/employees/list](http://localhost/8000/employees/list), the browser lists all the rows in the employee table.

## DetailView

The generic `DetailView` is found in the `django.views.generic.detail` module. Now, create its sub-class, `EmployeeDetail` (much the same way as `EmployeeList`). Note that this view shows the details of an object whose primary key is passed as an argument in the URL. So, add the following path in the app's URL pattern:

```Python
path('show/<int:pk>', EmployeeDetail.as_view(), name = 'EmployeeDetail') 
```

Again, the View object fetches the model instance and passes it as a context to the `employee_detail.html` template, which displays its attributes with template syntax as follows:

```HTML
<h1>Name : {{object.name}}</h1>   

    <p>Email : {{ object.email }}</p>   
    <p>Contact : {{ object.contact }}</p> 
```

Assuming the URL visited is `/employees/1`, the Employee record with primary key=1 will be displayed.

## UpdateView

This is another generic view, defined in `django.views.generic.edit` module. It renders a form in which the new values of the model attributes can be submitted. Set the fields attribute to `'__all__'` or to a list of updatable fields.

```Python
from django.views.generic.edit import UpdateView  
class EmployeeUpdate(UpdateView):   
    model = Employee   
    fields = '__all__'   
    success_url = "/employees/success/" 
```

Since this view is intended to update the data of a given model instance, its URL path must be configured accordingly:

```Python
path('update/<int:pk>', EmployeeUpdate.as_view(), name = 'EmployeeUpdate')
```

The example URL that invokes this view is `/employees/1`.

The `UpdateView` class renders the template with its name having `update_form` as suffix:

```HTML
#employee_update_form.html 
<form method="post"> 
{% csrf_token %} 
<table> 
    {{ form.as_table }} 
</table> 
    <input type="submit" value="Save"> 
</form> 
```

## DeleteView

Lastly, the generic view performs the delete operation on a model's given instance. It is present when editing the sub-module of `django.views.generic` module:

```Python
from django.views.generic.edit import DeleteView 
class EmployeeDelete(DeleteView):   
    model = Employee   
    success_url = "/employees/success/" 
```

You need to pass the primary key of the Employee model to this. So, the URL path is set as:

```Python
path('<delete/int:pk>', EmployeeDelete.as_view(), name = 'EmployeeDelete') 
```

The `employee_confirm_delete.html` template asks for confirmation from the user before removing the model instance.

```HTML
<form method="post"> 
{% csrf_token %}   

    <p>Are you sure you want to delete "{{ object }}"?</p>   

    <input type="submit" value="Confirm">   
</form> 
```

In this reading, you got to know about the class-based generic views to perform CRUD operations. Generic views are much easier to write than the `function_based` view, although both have their own advantages and disadvantages.
